It is to the harmony existing between\nAustria and Prussia that Germany owes the reali,ati\not her deruest wish, and to the same cause Europe owes it\nthat a general conflict has been averted.

Tee\nmemorial, which will cost about \u00a3l,OOO, has been de-\nsigned by Mr. T. Hayter Le a is, archite at, of Jehn\u2022\nstreet, Ad. Iphi, London. It will be a plan moeurnental\ncross in the style of the beeinning of the 13th oentue y,\n50 feet in height. The low, r p irt will consist of a\nseries of arch a forming an oceigonal arcade, supported\non 16 coupled colemns of Derbyshire marble, the\nprincipal part of the erection being of Portland stone.\nUnder this arcade will he placed marble tablets, ex-\nplaining the object of the memorial, and recoreing the\nnames of the m dicil officers who fell in the Crimean\nwar. This will be surmounted by a smaller arcade,\nalso of an octagonal form, the column thence tapering\nup gradually to a large cross. The site cho-en for the\ner ction is do eby the river front of the grouts, d\nnearly opposite the medical officers' quarters. The\ncontract for the erect cet of the monumeat has been\nteken by Messrs. Geerge Myers and Son, of London,\nwho bui.t the hospital, and the work will be executed\nunder the managemenc. of Major Ravenhill, R.E.\nThe hour fixed tar the arrival of the Piince of Wales\nom Osberne was half-past 12 o'clock, tit which time\nthe Royal yacht Fairy steamed up the river, roid abut\nten minutes afterwards the Prince landed at the pier,\naccompanied by his Royal Highness Prince Louis of\nHesse and the I'll- cc Lemingen.

The guard of\nhonour was comeose.l of 100 men of the 26th Regiment,\n(Cameronians), under command of Major Armstiong\nThe hand played the N eienal Anthem, and his Royal\nHighness was at once escorted up the grounds in front\nof the hospital to the ter ace at the main entrance. A\nprece-sion was formed, headed hy Captain Hawtree,\ncaptain of orderlies; and Lieutenant and Adjutant H.\nSeville. They were follow, d by the medical students\nand then the medical staff of the hospital, all in full\nuniforms, who e alked in advance of the Royal vi-itors\nand the military and naval enthorities to the site of the\nmonument. On reaching the ground the Prince was\nreceived with a Royal salute, and the band again played\nthe National Anthem, immediately after which he was\ncondected to the site of the monument by Colonel\nWilbraham. The pi weedings then commenced by Dr.\nGibson reading an address to the Prince, of which the\nfol'owing is a copy :\n\" May it phase your Royal Highness,\u2014During the\nwar with Russia in 1854, 1855, and 1856, her Maj sty's\narmy lost by death 54 officers of the medical dep irtm nt,\nwho were serving in the campaign, and six physicians\nand surgeons attached for duty to, but not commissioned\nofficers of, the army. The greater part of these gentle-\nmen died from disease contracted in the discharge of\ntheir duties, or broke down under the enormous pressure\nof professional work which was entailed upon them by\nthe sickly condition of the force in the e inter of 1854 5.\nOn the conclusion of the wer it appeared desirable that\nsome tribute should be paid to the m. mory of those who\nhad thus sactEced their live s in affording professional\naid to the solders who were gallantly fighting their\ncountry's battles, and a subscription was commenced for\nthat purpose, which was cOntributed to riot only by the\nofficers of the Medical Department, but also by other\nofficers of all ranks and by many civilians. Various\ncauses combined to delay the completion of the scheme\nthus laudably commenced, but at length the com-\nmittee to whom was intrusted its execution, in the\nbeginning of the present year, obtained from Mr.\nT. Hayter Lewi, F.S.A., a design for a monument\nwhich seem( d to them well calculated to effect the\nobject in view, and to hand down to succeeding genera-\ntions the mem:sl*y of th. Se medical officers who had\nperished in the service of their country in that war.\nThe committee have ventui ed to sulieit your Royal\nHighness to inaugurate the work by laying the founda-\ntion-stone from a feeling that such an act on the part of\nyour Royal Highness will he appreciated by the officers\nof the Army Medical Department, as a tribute to the\nmemory of their deceased comrades, and that the\ninterest shown by your Royal Highness in thus com-\nmemorating the services of those who have fallen at\ntheir posts in the discharge of arduous and important\ndutie cannot fail to prove a stimulus in future to us\nand to our successors zealously, faithfully, and Tear-\nleisly to discharge those duties which may fall to be\nperformed in the service of our Sovereign and for the\nhonour of our country.\"\nThe Address having been handed to the Prince of\nWales, his Royal Highness replied as follows:\n\"It gives me great pleasure to respond to your\nrequest to inaugurate this well-deserved tribute to the\nmemory of those medical officers who lost their lives in\nthe performance of their onerous and important duties\nin her Majesty's service throughout the war in the\nCrimea. It is also particularly agreeable to me to\nassist in the foundation of your memorial near this\nbuilding, connected as it is with the magnificent hos-\npital in the creation of which my beloved and lamented\nfather took so deep an interest, and in the maintenance\nof which the Queen also feels a like interest. The site\nchosen seems to be peculiarly appropriate, as, although\nthe main object of the establishment of this noble\nhospital was for the relief of the sick and wounded of\nthe army returning from the colonies, there is con-\nnected with it a medical school for the special instruc-\ntion of young medicil officers who are to have the\nfuture care of our soldiers in all climates\n.and in all\nparts of the world wherein our troops may be cal ed\nupon to serve. The names of tho e medical officers\ninscribed upon the me mmial will thus be inseparably\nconn cted with our great military hospital and our army\nmedical school.\"\n\nA prayer having been offtred up by the Rev. Mr.\nRawlins, temporarily acting as chap am n at the hospital,\nthe Prince WaS col,ducted to a table to app-nd his\nsignature to a copy of the addl.( as which was to be de-\n' ()sited under the foundaiion stone. This done, the\nbottle, cont,inirig copies of The Times, the address to the\nPrince, written on pa, cbment, and a photograph of the\nmonument, was seal, d up and deposited in a civity in\nthe stone. This stone was then lowered with the usual\nform 'Nies.\n\nThe Prince of Wales was IPudly cheered by the! spec-\ntators cn his ct parture from toe ground. He was\nsubsequently entertained at luncheon More returning to\nOsborne.\n\nGOVERNMENT ANNUITIES.\u2014In the Act passed on the\n14th of July to grant additonal facilities for the\n'purchase of small Government Annuities, and for\nassuring payments of money on cle..th, it is recited that\nin the Act 16 and 17 Vic., cap. 45, deferred annuities\nof small amount can only be granted upon the condi-\ntion that the full amount required to purchase such\nannuities be paid in one sum or by annual payments\nouring a course of years fixed at the time of purchase.\nIt also recites that under the same Art contracts for\npaymecit of a sum of money on deaih cannot be entered\ninto except on the condition that the party contracting\nfor such payment on death at the time purchase a\ndeferred annuity on his life. -The law is now alteted,\nand it is enacted that deferred annuities may be\ngranted on the condition to be fixed at the time of\npurchase, and that the sum requited to pinchase the\nannuity be payable in smaller instalmenta and_at\n137 rne\u2014former Act\nrzir;\u201e,,, the limit of the annuities, but they may\nnow extend to \u00a35O. The section requiring a\ndeferred annuity to be purchased of the Na-\ntional Debt Commissioners is now repealed in part.\nNo contract for a payment on death is to be entered\ninto by or on behalf of any person under the age of 16\nor over 60.

By this -Act it is provided that on a life policy\nafter the payments of the premiums for five years, a\nperson on surrendering the same is not to receive less\nthan one-third of the payments made, or may have\ngranted to him a paid-up policy on such an immediate\nor deferred life annuity. Jursdiction is given to the\nCounty Courts on the Commissioners of the National\nbt\n_refusing pa) ment.

The intelligence will be\ngratifying, because while the greater part of\nthe shareholders went into the business partly\nfor benevolent motives, yet capital cannot be.\nfound for the cultivation of cotton from philan-\nthropy. A company may be formed to try an\nexperiment, and money may be found to work\nit by parties who care not whether they gain or\nlose by the business as a monetary matter, but\nwhose great object will be secured by discover-\ning that they have been engaged in a profitable\ntransaction. Experiments are not substitutes\nfor industry, and the latter cannot be excited\nor maintained without remuneration. The\nJamaica Cotton Company has proved the capa-\nbility of growing first-class cotton on the\nI island, and it will next prove that the business\nmay be done at a paying price.\nFrom an address by Mr. Bourne, their secre-\ntary, to the operatives engaged in their planta-\ntions, which has been published in this country,\nwe learn that the Company has adopted an\nexcellent principle in settling the relations\nbetween the employers and those persons who\nare engaged by them. The Company will pay\na fixed rate of wages for work done, to be sup-\nplemented at the close of the year's accounts by\na part bf the profits realised. Thus the opera-\ntives become interested as partners without\nrisk in the success of the work. Although they\nhave no direct liability for failure, yet they\nhave all the excitement of responsibility. '1 hey\nhave even the risk of expected earnings. Ac-\ntivity and economy brings them a reward in\naddition to weekly pay, for skill or toil. Tinder\nthis system, fairly administered, the in-\nterest of all classes may be consulted\nand secured. Capital and enterprise\nreap the reward to which they\nindisputably entitled, and labour and skill wi\nsee in the prosperity of their avocations\n\nare\n\nsecurity for their own well-being. This is the\nonly principle on which we can expect to have\nthe interestS of capital and labour reconciled.\nWe know that it is the duty of the employer\nto give a fair day's wages for a fair day's work,\nbut difficulties arise in estimating the precise\nsum, and they are. in this manner entirely\nobviated.\n\nWe have had reason ere now to mention\nfavourably the plan and purpose of the Jamaica\nCotton Compai y, and their adoption, at the\nbeginning, of a good principle in the division\nof results, entitles them to good wishes for\ntheir prosperity and success. An agitation has\nbeen commenced in this country against the\npurchase of goods made from slave-grown\ncotton. Ladies in some places have signed\ndeclarations of their purpose never more to be\nclothed in ginghams or prints tinged with the\naccursed thing. It is right to banish Achan\nfrom the camp or the household, if the ladies\ncan identify him, but they will experience\ndifficulty in discriminating between the false\nand the true. We have seen a sugar mer-\nchant's taste vindicated in the discovery by\nthat test alone of the nativity of specimens, not\nshown to him, but placed in his mouth. He\nwas an excellent judge of the commodity, for\nin one case he confessed that he had never\ntasted sugar previously of the description\ngiven to him, and could not say where\nit had been grown. The specimen was taken\nout of a small parcel made from a new material.\nBut we do not believe that free grown cotton\nturned into goods and yarns can ever be dis-\ntinguished from slave grown, by sight or taste.\nParliament could levy a discriminative tax on\nslave- grown cotton, but it will not adopt that\ncourse; and a better remedy will be found in\npromoting the growth of this commodity in the\ncolonies and in India. The ladies who have\nadopted this discriminative declaration should\ntake an interest in the cotton-growing coin-\npanics; accomplish their objects and earn\nfive per cent.; and larger dividends may be\nearned, which the shareholders, if they dislike\nthem, need not spend.\n\nDEATH IN THE PIT.-DITTIES OF\nINSPECTORS.\n\nr resume our remarks upon the subject of\nthe Edmund's Main Catastrophe, from last\nweek.\n\nThe fact is, in the South Yorkshire district,\nthe inspector is a known sympathiser with the\ninterests of capital. To him labour is but a\nthing with which the less law interferes to\nprotect the better. True to his politico-\neconomic creed, he gets as much salary and\ndoes as little for it as he can. He never visits a\npit when he dares to stop away. He never\nmakes a tour of inspection to see the law is\nobserved to prevent accidents; and, when sent\nfor by the men's fears, either notice is sent of\nhis coming, or some hint is given about the\ncomplaint, so that when a flying visit is made\nthere is nothing to see, and the men get a\nrebuke, or a discharge. Thus, the men object\nto report or complain of danger. 'There are\nscores of pits in Yorkshire that the -inspector\nhas never once been into; and hundreds of\nmen who neither know his face nor his address.\nThe inspector is bound to attend all inquests of\ndeath from accident's in pits held in this dis-\ntrict; he does not always do even that, or he\ncomes to view long after all traces of accident,\nor rather of the causes, are carefully removed.\nAnd the result is, whereas in the Factories' In- '\nspection Act, detection of breach of law before\naccidents, and of punishment accordingly, are '\nfrequent, under the Mines' Inspection Act\nbreaches of law before accidents are never\nheard of, and but very rarely convictions or\npunishment, when accidents have occurred,. that\nis, so far as employers are concerned. But\nwoe be to the poor miner who is either caught\nslipping, or if even the idea of a slip can be\ndetected. The- inspector then is truly a\nterror, and his wrath is something awful.\nHe carefully avticls having anything to do with\nthe men, and if a aeputation venture to seek\nan interview, he appoints his own house, per-\nhaps miles away, and therefore, practically, a\nbar to workmen going. And if even that be\ngot over, all that cold shoulder officialism, and\nthe most offensive red.tapeism, can show is\nshown. Formali*l4.,riect, ' and 'even\n_icule and nairgiffhe eWrience of parties\nwho have once sought his presence by appoint-\nment; and we leave the reader to judge whether\nan independent soul'd working man is likely\ntwice to submit to such treatment. We assure\nour readers that this, and worse; is the rule of\nthe conduct of Charles Merton, of St. John's,\nWakefield, Esquire, who, as a public officer, is\nwe submit, fairly open to criticism, as to his\npublic duty. And it is chien this way, to\nthe complete failure- of the Working of the\nInspectors' Act\u2014and herein,lies\n~the\nthat we attribute the fearful loss of li\nthat South ' Viire is subject to. The\nchief ' risk, that of life, is run by I\nmen; and it was to protect the men that tlke\nact, in. defiance of the opposition of the\nployers, was passed. But by the connivance\nof the Derby ministry, then in. power, and by\nthe efforts of J. C. Charlesworth, the chairman\nof the coal owners' associatAn, then M.P. for\nWakefield, it was referred to them to appoint\nthe inspectors. Of course they chose their\ninstill-Incas accordingly, and in this case the\nemployers have been most. fortunate in their\nselection. In Yorkshire, the act is worked to\nserve the employer; and the men suffer accor-\ndingly. Had the men their say in the appoint-\nment, (and we would ask if this is not as fair\nan interpretation of the object of the act, as\nthat the employers should rule the inspectors?)\nwe submit we should bear less of \" Barns-\nley Tragedies.\" Then the employers would\nhave tobe a little nifire attentive, and perhaps\na little more costly in their appliances, but it\nwould be true policy to enforce upon them.\nThe cost of these explosions is ruinous even to\nthe employers. And what is the 'reason the\nworking men have not their legitimate say, in\nthe measures vital to their own safety? The\nworkilig men are not, represented in the Com-\nmorm-House of Parliament--and the masters\nare. Working men ponder over that fact, 'and\nsee the censequences, even in the working of\nthe miner's act.. How long will labour endure '\nits burthens? when will it rise and assert its\nown rights and dignity? and put capital and\ninspectors in their true place, viz., as means to\nserve .humanity, and not to oppress and abuse?\nThe poor miner might then have length of days,\ninstead of the shortest life, and comfort and\nindependence, instead of pity and contempt.\nBut never as things are.\nA report of the coroner's inquest held on the\nWorsbro Dale tragedy has been published, and\nwe especially direct the attention of\nour readers to the facts elicited. It will be seen\nclearly that the fault of this misfortune is not\nwith the men. Blasting in a dangerous place\nis the certain cause of the explosion. Now\nwho caused the men to blast? So far as they\nwere concerned, the men proposed to wedge\nthe coal; but then such is the nature of the\nprices paid, that they could not live by wedg.\u2022\nmg. Then the pressure of the masters, and\nthe stimulus of extra pay, caused the men to\n","403071":"THE EXPLOSION AT CHILWORTH.\n\nOn the 6th of August an. inquest on the tolies of\nJohn Farnfield and Charles Mansell, the unfortunate\nmen who were killed by the late explosion, was opened '\nby Mr. C. J. Woods, coroner for the western division of\nSurrey, at the Percy Arms Inn. The room in which\nthe inquiry was conducted, and which was situate atout\na quarter of a mile from the powder mills, was a long\napartment, furnished with numerous windows, all of\nwhich had been demolished by the explosion. The\nCoroner said that in this inquiry it would be neces-\nsary to ascertain not merely the cluse of death, but\nalso whether the machinery employed at the powder\nmills was proper for the particular manufacture,\nand, whether due precautions were taken for the\nprevention of accidents: His pra sent intention was\nmerely to open the inqulry and then adjourn it. After\nthe jury had seen the bodies and the scene of the ex-\nplosion, the following evidence was taken :\u2014Jare e 3\nWilliam Upfold, foreman of Mr. Share's gi,nnowder\nworks, said he last saw the deceased alive about 10\nminutes past 11 o'clock on Friday morn:ng, when tiny\nwere both standing at the door of the press-house\npress-house frem 7 o'clock on Friday morning, raid\ntalking to him. They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found. Mansell\nhad been employed upon the works for the past two\nyears, and Farnfield almost from his infancy. The\nmachinery in the press-room was new except the by-\ndraulic press, which had been in work about seven ye irs.\nWhen the witness EitNY the deceased at the door of the\npress-house both bad on their working dress. At this\nstage of the proceedings the inquiry was adjourned, and\nit was resolved that in the meantime the Board of Trade\nAhould be requested to send a competent person imme_\ndiately to inspect the scene of the accident.\n\nOUR MINERAL WEALTH.\u2014 1 hrough the courtesy of\nour esteemed correspondent, Mr. Robert Hunt, F,R.S.,\nthe Keeper of Mining Records at the Royal School of\nMines, we have been favoured with the statistics of our\nmineral production for 1863, which will be issued to\nthe public in a week or ten days from this time. The\nvalue of the minerals produced was \u00a329,151,976, from\nwhich metals of the value of \u00a336,364,327 were extracted.\nOf gold quartz we produced 385 tons, worth \u00a31,500; of\ntin ore, 15,157 tons, worth \u00a3963,985; of copper ore,\n212,947 tons, worth t,100,554; of lead ore, 91,283\ntons, worth \u00a31,193,530 ; of silver ore, 38 ton., worth\n\u00a35,703; and of zinc ore, 1,941 tons, worth \u00a329,968.\nDuring the year in question there were sold 95,376\ntons of pyrites, for \u00a362,035; and the rarer mimnils\u2014\nwolfram, uranium, gossans,\nof\nn.c, and earthy minera's\nraised were of the value ot \u00a31,980,866. Th se items, i\nwith the value of 9,101,552 tons of ron ore, \u00a33,240,890,\nand 86,292 215 tons of coal, \u00a320,572,945, raises the\ntotal to \u00a329,151,976, which was manufactured into\nnearly \u00a340,000,000 of merchantable produce. To pro-\nduce these results direct employment has been given to\nat least 500,000 men, so that our mineral industries may\nbe considered as alone supportipg a population of nearly\n3,000,000, in addition to adding !much to the general\nwealth of the kingdom, and especially to the wealth of\nthose whose capital has been employed in mining ope-\nrations.\u2014Afinirq Journal.\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO A CHILD AT A RAILWAY STA-\nTION.--A frightful accident has occurred to Frederick\nPacker, a boy 11 years of age, at the New-cross station\nof the Brighton Railway. It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally. This com-\npany paid \u00a38,351 as compsnsation for personal injui\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BATH.\u2014The Queen has been\ngraciously pleased to give orders for the following\nappointments to the Most Honounble Order of the\nBath.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep. These\npowders were to be tatters in preserves' and on Tuesday\nmorning, the nurse having prrpared one for Mrs.\nRawlin, in order to give it to her as soon as she awoke\n(she was then sleeping with the child by her side)' left\n, the room. On her rcturn, Mrs. Rawlin told her that\nthe child had been out of bed and eaten \"the goody.\"\nHe was then snoring loudly, and although she tried to\nrouse him she could not, and he shortly afterwards died.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death.\"\u2014\nWeeeli:ld Journal.\nTHE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT MONT-\nGOLFIER BALLOON. Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife. If Johnson's wife had lived there\nwould have been no hoarding up of bits of orange-peel;\nno touching all the, posts in walking along the street;\nno eating and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If\nOliver Goldsmith had been married he would never\nhave worn that memorable and ridiculous coat. When-\never you find a man whom you know little about oddly\ndressed, or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any\neccentricity of manner, you may be tolerably sure that\nhe is not a married man. For the little corners are\nrounded off, the little shoots ate pruned away, in\nmarried men. Wives generally have much more sense\nthan their husbands, especially when the husbands are\nclever men. The wive's advices are like the ballast\nthat keeps the ship steady. They are like the whole-\nsome though painful, shears snipping off little growths\nof self-coneeit and folly.\u2014 \"leaser-\n\nTHE REGISTER-G\n\nThe Register-G.neral 1\nquarterly report to. eonstr\nthe principal Eng`rash wat\nsome useful advice.

The ecclesiastical revenues of that\ncountry being applied to purposes calculated to\npromote its secular interests ;\" and, in his excellent\nspeech in support of that view, took occasion to say,\nthat \"As regarded the application of the funds of\nthe Irish Church, he had a proposition to make\nwhich he did not think had been previously sug-\ngested. In Ireland they had millions of acres of\nland at present unclaimed, and it would be a prac-\ntical proposition to devote the funds of the Irish\nChurch to the purposes of reclaiming these waste\nlauds. The land so reclaimed to be let direct from\nthe Crown, and they would get a peasant proprietary\nin Ireland who would have a direct interest in their\nloyalty.\"\nThe Rev. Mr. Doxey said, \"The suggestion of\nMr. iones was a most practical one, which they\nmight present to the Rouse of Commons, because it\noffered some solution of the land question.\" Well\ndone, Mr. Jones and Mr. Doxey. The ball begins\nto move in the right direction, and may it roll\nonward to its final goal, is my most ardent wish.\nWhat, however, seems to me somewhat singular\nand amusing is, that the Rev. C. Neville and Mr.\nT. Dunning are reported as taking part in a meeting\nwhere such a \"dreamy\" and \"impracticable\" sug-\ngestion as \"letting the land direct from the crown\"\nis said to have been received with such favour.\n\nI wonder whether these two gentlemen fled from\nthe meeting in dismay when the idea of \"holding\nland direct from the crown \".was suggested, which,\nin other words, simply means the state; or whether\nthey retired into a corner of the room in a state of\nalarm for the fate of their adopted child\u2014land-\nlordism. The fact that men of education and high\nattainments were absolutely \"dreaming\" about\n\"letting land direct from the crown\" instead of\nselling it to the men with the money bags. I sin-\ncerely hope it had as happy an effect upon these two\ngentlemen as it appears to have had upon the\nmeeting.\nz . \u2022 ..\n\nI als-o c\/ommend to the serious attention of Mr.\nStephenson, of Halifax, the excellent suggestion of\n3-fr. c 1.1-=.4 above ineetintr. T havn pd_set\nbeen able to learn that gentleman's views upon the\nland question from anything he has written, but if\nhe approves the doctrine of Mr. John Stuart Mill,\nwhich he quotes, namely :\u2014\" That the claims of the\nlandlords to the land must be, and always is, subor-\ndinate to the general policy of the state,\" I have\ngood hopes of him.\nIn conclusion, I beg to say that if avik.Dublic\nmeetingtan be got upon the subject the begi fling\nof the new year, as suggested in last week's\nBEEHIVE, I shall be most happy to attend it, and\nso far as possible promote the objects of the meet-\ning. _ ALFRED A.

Having seen a balance-sheet of\nthe Reform Fete and Banquet in your edition of last\nSaturday, I most distinctly deny being indebted to\nthe committee at all; in fact, it is the other way,\nfor they are indebted to me for wages due, and\nwhich never yet have been settled. And in respect\n, to the receipt held by Mr. Murray from me, it is the\nsame as every other receipt given, and is entered in\nthe book as such, and was checked by the auditors,\nif such you call them,: for I am perfectly satisfied\nthey know as much about the accounts now as they\ndid before ever seeing' then. If that is not the case,\nwhy have they not published the whole of the de-\nfaulters; or perhaps they thought it much easier to\n, put it all on to me, whom they rEpresent as financial\nI secretary, but which .was never my position.

As was generally expected, the thousands of men.\nemployed have accepted the reduction. It was generally\nagreed that if any resistance were offered on the part\nof the hands many establishments would he altogether\nclosed. Ten per cent. is to be the amount of the\nreduction, and all hands, with the exception of the col-\nliers, will have to submit to it.

The ecclesiastical revenues of that\ncountry being applied to purposes calculated to\npromote its secular interests ;\" and, in his excellent\nspeech in support of that view, took occasion to say,\nthat \"As regarded the application of the funds of\nthe Irish Church, he had a proposition to make\nwhich he did not think had been previously sug-\ngested. In Ireland they had millions of acres of\nland at present unclaimed, and it would be a prac-\ntical proposition to devote the funds of the Irish\nChurch to the purposes of reclaiming these waste\nlauds. The land so reclaimed to be let direct from\nthe Crown, and they would get a peasant proprietary\nin Ireland who would have a direct interest in their\nloyalty.\"\nThe Rev. Mr. Doxey said, \"The suggestion of\nMr. iones was a most practical one, which they\nmight present to the Rouse of Commons, because it\noffered some solution of the land question.\" Well\ndone, Mr. Jones and Mr. Doxey. The ball begins\nto move in the right direction, and may it roll\nonward to its final goal, is my most ardent wish.\nWhat, however, seems to me somewhat singular\nand amusing is, that the Rev. C. Neville and Mr.\nT. Dunning are reported as taking part in a meeting\nwhere such a \"dreamy\" and \"impracticable\" sug-\ngestion as \"letting the land direct from the crown\"\nis said to have been received with such favour.\n\nI wonder whether these two gentlemen fled from\nthe meeting in dismay when the idea of \"holding\nland direct from the crown \".was suggested, which,\nin other words, simply means the state; or whether\nthey retired into a corner of the room in a state of\nalarm for the fate of their adopted child\u2014land-\nlordism. The fact that men of education and high\nattainments were absolutely \"dreaming\" about\n\"letting land direct from the crown\" instead of\nselling it to the men with the money bags. I sin-\ncerely hope it had as happy an effect upon these two\ngentlemen as it appears to have had upon the\nmeeting.\nz . \u2022 ..\n\nI als-o c\/ommend to the serious attention of Mr.\nStephenson, of Halifax, the excellent suggestion of\n3-fr. c 1.1-=.4 above ineetintr. T havn pd_set\nbeen able to learn that gentleman's views upon the\nland question from anything he has written, but if\nhe approves the doctrine of Mr. John Stuart Mill,\nwhich he quotes, namely :\u2014\" That the claims of the\nlandlords to the land must be, and always is, subor-\ndinate to the general policy of the state,\" I have\ngood hopes of him.\nIn conclusion, I beg to say that if avik.Dublic\nmeetingtan be got upon the subject the begi fling\nof the new year, as suggested in last week's\nBEEHIVE, I shall be most happy to attend it, and\nso far as possible promote the objects of the meet-\ning. _ ALFRED A.

Having seen a balance-sheet of\nthe Reform Fete and Banquet in your edition of last\nSaturday, I most distinctly deny being indebted to\nthe committee at all; in fact, it is the other way,\nfor they are indebted to me for wages due, and\nwhich never yet have been settled. And in respect\n, to the receipt held by Mr. Murray from me, it is the\nsame as every other receipt given, and is entered in\nthe book as such, and was checked by the auditors,\nif such you call them,: for I am perfectly satisfied\nthey know as much about the accounts now as they\ndid before ever seeing' then. If that is not the case,\nwhy have they not published the whole of the de-\nfaulters; or perhaps they thought it much easier to\n, put it all on to me, whom they rEpresent as financial\nI secretary, but which .was never my position. I\nshall, however, take the earliest opportunity of\n,\ngoing over the whole of the accounts with a prac-\ntical accountant. Hoping you will insert this, I\nam, yours, &C.

On\nThursday the deceased was eating his dinner, when he\nbegan to cough, and putting his hand before his mouth\nto prevent the meat he was masticating from corning\nout, in consequence of which a portion of it got into\nthe windpipe, and he died about three or four minutes\nafter. The jury returned a verdict to the effect that the\ndeceased was Accidentally choked.\nTHE REDUCTION OF WAGES IN SOUTH WALES.\u2014The\nnotice of a reduction in wages expires at the principal\nironworks of South Wales at the end of this month, the\nmonth's notice having been given on the Ist of Decem-\nber. As was generally expected, the thousands of men.\nemployed have accepted the reduction. It was generally\nagreed that if any resistance were offered on the part\nof the hands many establishments would he altogether\nclosed. Ten per cent. is to be the amount of the\nreduction, and all hands, with the exception of the col-\nliers, will have to submit to it.

You say that if the\nfund had fallen short it would have been met by a\n'levy, but that in your time no levy ha 3 been neces-\nsary P\u2014The number of members la_ray time was\nnever less than 600 members, and Of course 600\n\u2022 -I:pall M.34,-each cleared it.\nEarl of Lichfield At the tini(that you are\nstaking of, at what age were.-- your members\n_tvritteci, had you any fixed age ?\u2014Yes, 18.\nThey\nAn\n\u2014Y\n\n-\"R\n\u2014Tt just depends upon the num\ntick together; perhaps after a strike\nnot be \u2022 many members that !_ would . sti\n\nsociety, a strike might upset the society and Mil\nonly a few in who would be receiving accident\nmoney. _ . _\n\nMr. Hughes: During your time the number of\nmembers have varied from 600 to 3,000 P\u2014Yes,\nthere are 5,000 now.\nHave they steadily increased in number P\u2014They\nhave never decreased to less than 600.\nBut have they ever been at one time 3,000 arid\nthen 2,500 afterwards, for instance P\u2014They have\ngot up to 1,200 and then got back to 600.\nSo that 600 men must have left at that time P\n\nThey went, of course, off the accident and the\nfuneral fund entirely F\u2014Out of the trade entirely;\nthey went away andibecame non-soeiety men.\nThey would no longer have any claim on the\nfunds of the society P\u2014No. Then since Locket went\naway with that \u00a31,300 they altered the initiation\nmoney, that is to say, they took members in for less\nmoney.

The ecclesiastical revenues of that\ncountry being applied to purposes calculated to\npromote its secular interests ;\" and, in his excellent\nspeech in support of that view, took occasion to say,\nthat \"As regarded the application of the funds of\nthe Irish Church, he had a proposition to make\nwhich he did not think had been previously sug-\ngested. In Ireland they had millions of acres of\nland at present unclaimed, and it would be a prac-\ntical proposition to devote the funds of the Irish\nChurch to the purposes of reclaiming these waste\nlauds. The land so reclaimed to be let direct from\nthe Crown, and they would get a peasant proprietary\nin Ireland who would have a direct interest in their\nloyalty.\"\nThe Rev. Mr. Doxey said, \"The suggestion of\nMr. iones was a most practical one, which they\nmight present to the Rouse of Commons, because it\noffered some solution of the land question.\" Well\ndone, Mr. Jones and Mr. Doxey. The ball begins\nto move in the right direction, and may it roll\nonward to its final goal, is my most ardent wish.\nWhat, however, seems to me somewhat singular\nand amusing is, that the Rev. C. Neville and Mr.\nT. Dunning are reported as taking part in a meeting\nwhere such a \"dreamy\" and \"impracticable\" sug-\ngestion as \"letting the land direct from the crown\"\nis said to have been received with such favour.\n\nI wonder whether these two gentlemen fled from\nthe meeting in dismay when the idea of \"holding\nland direct from the crown \".was suggested, which,\nin other words, simply means the state; or whether\nthey retired into a corner of the room in a state of\nalarm for the fate of their adopted child\u2014land-\nlordism. The fact that men of education and high\nattainments were absolutely \"dreaming\" about\n\"letting land direct from the crown\" instead of\nselling it to the men with the money bags. I sin-\ncerely hope it had as happy an effect upon these two\ngentlemen as it appears to have had upon the\nmeeting.\nz . \u2022 ..\n\nI als-o c\/ommend to the serious attention of Mr.\nStephenson, of Halifax, the excellent suggestion of\n3-fr. c 1.1-=.4 above ineetintr. T havn pd_set\nbeen able to learn that gentleman's views upon the\nland question from anything he has written, but if\nhe approves the doctrine of Mr. John Stuart Mill,\nwhich he quotes, namely :\u2014\" That the claims of the\nlandlords to the land must be, and always is, subor-\ndinate to the general policy of the state,\" I have\ngood hopes of him.\nIn conclusion, I beg to say that if avik.Dublic\nmeetingtan be got upon the subject the begi fling\nof the new year, as suggested in last week's\nBEEHIVE, I shall be most happy to attend it, and\nso far as possible promote the objects of the meet-\ning. _ ALFRED A.

It was generally\nagreed that if any resistance were offered on the part\nof the hands many establishments would he altogether\nclosed. Ten per cent. is to be the amount of the\nreduction, and all hands, with the exception of the col-\nliers, will have to submit to it.

The greater part of these gentle-\nmen died from disease contracted in the discharge of\ntheir duties, or broke down under the enormous pressure\nof professional work which was entailed upon them by\nthe sickly condition of the force in the e inter of 1854 5.\nOn the conclusion of the wer it appeared desirable that\nsome tribute should be paid to the m. mory of those who\nhad thus sactEced their live s in affording professional\naid to the solders who were gallantly fighting their\ncountry's battles, and a subscription was commenced for\nthat purpose, which was cOntributed to riot only by the\nofficers of the Medical Department, but also by other\nofficers of all ranks and by many civilians. Various\ncauses combined to delay the completion of the scheme\nthus laudably commenced, but at length the com-\nmittee to whom was intrusted its execution, in the\nbeginning of the present year, obtained from Mr.\nT. Hayter Lewi, F.S.A., a design for a monument\nwhich seem( d to them well calculated to effect the\nobject in view, and to hand down to succeeding genera-\ntions the mem:sl*y of th.

It is also particularly agreeable to me to\nassist in the foundation of your memorial near this\nbuilding, connected as it is with the magnificent hos-\npital in the creation of which my beloved and lamented\nfather took so deep an interest, and in the maintenance\nof which the Queen also feels a like interest. The site\nchosen seems to be peculiarly appropriate, as, although\nthe main object of the establishment of this noble\nhospital was for the relief of the sick and wounded of\nthe army returning from the colonies, there is con-\nnected with it a medical school for the special instruc-\ntion of young medicil officers who are to have the\nfuture care of our soldiers in all climates\n.and in all\nparts of the world wherein our troops may be cal ed\nupon to serve.

The case was a very peculiar one. The\naccident took place at Copley Hill, Leeds, so far back\nas Oct. 16, 1867, but it was not till November, 1868,\nthat plaintiff was permanently. disabled. in the\nmeantime he had been engaged ,as local secretary of\nthe British and Foreign Bible Society .at a salary of\n\u00a33OO per year, and travelled about the country, de-\nlivering addresses on its behalf. On November 12,\n1868, thirteen months after the accident,'he \"had, a\nparalytic attack which rendered him so complete a\nwreck that his evidence had to be taken by commis-\nsion. The question in dispute - was whether the\nparalysis resulted from the accident. The defendants\ncontended that it was too remote from the time of the\ncollision to have been caused by it, and the fact that\nthe plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel\nabout the country and deliver addresses, night after\nnight, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible\nBociety, was relied on in proof of this. On the other\nside it was maintained that from the time of the acci-\ndent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the\nfinal seizure, and that there was a continuity of\nSymptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were\ncalled on each side who directly contradicted each\nother as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The\njudge, in summing up, said the plaintiff was clearly\nentitled to damages for the sufferings he had under-\ngone since the time of the accident, but he could give\nno assistance as to the real point at issue. After a\nconsultation of twenty minutes, the jury returned a\nverdict for the plaintiff\u2014Damages \u00a32,000.\n","400562":"NEW COUPLING FOIL RAILWAY\n\nCARRIAGES.\n\nThe object of this contrivance, which consists of a\nmodification of the ordinary coupling, is to cut off the\nconnection between the engine and carriages of a train\nwhenever the engine runs off the rails, so as to prevent\nthe rest of the train being dragged after it over em-\nbankments or bridges. The ordinary coupling consists\nof draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws'\nso as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train\nclose together. There are also safety chains, one on\neach side of the main coupling. The improvement\ncomes into action the moment the engine or tender\nhappens to diverge at a certain angle from the line\nof railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of\ngear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are\ndriven back by the springs into the void left by the\ndraw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are\ninstantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame\nof the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com-\npletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears\nthat accidents from engines running off the rails amount\nto more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci-\ndents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the\nIst of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from\nthis cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas-\nsengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861\nthere were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas-\nsengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862\nthere were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and\n282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci-\ndents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail-\nway, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and\ninjury to 161 persons, making together in the course of\n3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running\noff the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63\npersons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons,\nbesides involving destruction of rolling stock and large\nsurna for compensation. This indicates to some extent\nthe advantage of adopting the system of coupling\npatented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia-\nment-street, and which appears to be very complete in\nevery respect for the purpose intended. It is in course\nof being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains\nen the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from\nthat cause have heretofore been rather more frequent\nthan on other railways A full-sized model of the\napparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament-\nstreet, which will enable those who are interested in\npreventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It\nis rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of\nrailways have no power to require the adoption of any\nimprovement that might appear to them calculatedito\nprevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although\nthey have power to prevent the opening of a railway\nfor traffic until all the requirements as to the stability\nof the works and the efficiency of the signals have been\nfully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the\nrailway department of the Board of Trade.\n\nANOTHER DANGEROUS FREAK OF A SAILOR.\u2014On the\nmorning of December 10, about four o'clock, as the mail\ntrain going north was, passing through Broughton, on\nthe Lancaster and Preston Railway., about a mile south\nof the Broughton and Barton Station, a sailor, a pas-\nal\nfull\nreipea geeds. , stepped out\nIle fell on\nos efn\nthe\ner i\ntrainu on one\nso of thew asee cgoingon dt\nclasse carriages,\nthe line, but fortunately received no further injuries\nthan slight bruises on one shoulder and, one knee. There\nwere three other sailors in the same compartment, and\nall of them having been partaking rather too freely of\ngrog, they had been fast asleep.. One of them awaken-\ning, being under the impression that he was at his\njourney's end, got up with the intention of alighting,\nand stepped out, but was surprised on finding himself\ncast to the ground with much force. On recovering\nfrom the shock of his fall, he saw the signal light off\nthe station at Barton ahead, and made his way thither,\nand related to the astonished station master his adven-\nture. He remained at the station about fourhours, until\nthe arrival of the next train which stopped there when\nhe was sent onwards. Except that no startling there,\nof\na Muller-like catastrophe followed the discovery of the\nsailor having fallen from the carriage, the incident is\nsomething like one which occurred on the London and\nNorth Western Railway, a few days ago, when a drunken\n' sailor fell out of the train when at full speed, and his\ncompanions were apprenended on the charge of murder,\nand were only released on their companion appearing in\npropria persona, and unhurt, to tell the Pile\u00b0 he had\nnot been murdered.\nTHE PEACE ADDRESS TO THE -UNITED STATBS.\nWashington dispatch says :\u2014About six weeks ago, Mr.\nJoseph Parker, of Manchester, England, arrived at\nNew York, bringing with him the peace address of the\nsubjects of Great Britain and Ireland, with a letter\nfrom Sir Henry de lloughton to Governor Seymour,\nwho declined formally to receive it, ;\nase.gning as a\nreason that it should be given to the President of the\nUnited States, the latter being the only authorised\nchannel of communication between other nations and\nthe citizens of the United States. Mr. Parker, having\narrived here last week, addressed a note to Secretary\nSeward, stating that he had been deputed to this coun-\ntry to convey the address to the people of the United\nStates, and asking the honour of an oPPertunity of\npresenting it to the President. To this the secretary\nreplied that, before answering the letter, it was desir-\nable to be further informed whether Mr. Parker had\nany authority from the Government of Great Britain\nand Ireland for the purpose referred to, and whether\nhis mission had been made known to the diplomatic\nagent of that government near the e\nbevernment of\nthe United States. Mr. Parker replied bY saying that\nthe address he had the honour of bringing to this\ncountry, containing the signatures. of 350,000 of his\ncountrymen, from the peer to the artisan, was not from\nthe Government of Great Britain, nor from any political\nparty. It was simply an expression of the earnest\ndesire of Great Britain to see Peace restored to this\ncountry. The correspondence closed by a note from\nthe Secretary of State, in which he said the Govern-\nment of the United States could not receive the\naddress, and that the request for an interview with the\nPresident was, therefore, declined. The intention now\nis to present the address to Congress at the approaching\nsession. \u2022\nMATTHEWS AND THE REWARD.\u2014.There is RO truth\nin the watement that Matthews has received the\nreward offered for the conviction of Muller. The\nrailway company and the bank have handed over their\nrespective sums to Sir Richard Mayne, and when\nGovernment have added their portiun, the question of\nhow the money should be divided will then come under\nconsideration. It is said, however, that it will be\nequally divided between Mr. Death; Matthews, and the\ntwo Repsches. Inspector Tanner will not, as is gene-\nrally supposed, Come in for any portion of the reward.\nIn fact, beyond his salary, there is no recognition of the\nservices rendered by this intelligent officer, and unless\nthe public think proper to accord him some mark of\ntheir approbation he will go unrewarded. \u2022\n\nBREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE.\nIn the Court of C..ommen- Pleason December 10, an\naction\u2014Wylie v. Baser was brought to recover\ndamages for breach of promis- of marriage. The de-\nfendant, by his plead', gs, denied the promise, anal\nalsl alleged that a roast) ,able time for the ,performanoe\nof the promise had not been a lowed.\nMr. Gitiard and Mr. rll.l,,chlan were for the plaintiff;\nMr. Phil brick for the defendant,\nMr. G.ffard said he oelieved he could fully establish\nboth the promise, and the refusal to perform it, and that\nthe only question for the jury would be the amount of\ndamages. The plaintiff, Mrs. Elizabeth Mary Wylie,\nwas a widow. The oefendant was a grocer at South\nNorwood. The plaintiff had for some time been employed\nas a housekeeper; and it was through the defendant\nbeing in want of a houskeeper that he first met Mrs.\nWylie. He was gre aly taken with her. They\nbecame intimate, and at length the defendant engaged\nto marry the plaintiff on Cioydan :Fair day. The\ndefendant was a widower, between 50 and 60 years of\nage, with a grown up family, and after having engaged\nhimself to the plaintiff he introduced her to his family,\nand afterwards gave her to understand that they were\ngreatly p'eased with her. The letters which he had\nwritten to her would clearly show the relation in which\nthey stood. The learned gentleman then read the\nfollowing letters addressed by the defendant to the\nplaintiff:\u2014\n\n\"5, Porthurl road, South Norwood,\nAugust 10, 1864.\n\"My dearest Mrs. W,\u2014l arrived home quite safe\nabout eleven o'clock last evening. lam very pleased\nto say that I feel all the better for my trip, but did not\nlike parting with you, and watched you as far as I\ncould see you, but could not get you to look back after\npoor me.

He tells all my friends\nwhat a nice little body I have found, but he ,still\nwonders where I found you. I got censured for leaving\nyou that unlucky Tuesday as I did, and wanted to know\nhow I could behave so rude to, you: So, after all this,\nI shall be so happy to introduce you to my daughter;\nbut shasays shetwould rather see you first at her house,\nwhich I shall arrange.

You will come by the train which\nleaves Victoria at 12.12, and I will meet you.--I am,\nmy dearest little pet, your own most affectionate\n\"W.\nIn a subsequent letter, Mr. Giffard continued, the de-\nfendant advised the plaintiff to go to Newington Church,\nand then she heard the banns proclaimed between\nherself and the defendant. In another letter he said,\n\"I do not think it is possible for me to wait until the\nfair. lam so cold at nights that you must come and\nkeep me warm.\" (Laughter.) It would be unnecesSary\nto read more letters. He (Mr. Giflard) would show\nthat the defendant refused to perform the promise so dis-\ntinctly established by the correspondeace. The defen-\ndant had a good business, and would be able to pay\nsubstantial damages. The lady being'3B, it might be\nthought her feelings were less acute than those of a\nyoung maiden; but it may be considered that this was\npossibly her last chance. (Laughter.)\nMr. Greenwood, the plaintiff's attorney, was called,\nand stated that after his first letter on the subject of the\npromise the defendant called on him and said he could\nnot perform his promise, as his children thought the\nplaintiff too young for him. He would pay the expense\nof cheap lodgings for Mrs. Wylie until she got a situ-\nation. He wished to see the plaintiff privately, but\nhe (the witness) would only agree to this on condition\nthat the meeting took place at his own office. In his\nre-examination, he stated that his reason for this was\nthat the plaintiff had told him the defendant had be-\nhaved improperly to her when they were alone.\nMr. Philbrick then addressed the jury for the defend-\nant, and said that he should be able to satisfy them\nthat the plaintiff had conseeted to the marriage not\n\u2022 taking place until a later period than stated, and that\nthis action was brought too soon, as a reasonable time\nfor the marriage had not arrived when the action was\ncommenced.\nTwo witnesses were called, a tailor and his wife, of\nwhom the defendant had ordered the clothes he intended\nto be married in; but their evidence,: taken at the utmost\nvalue for the defendant, only fixed the event for some\nday subsequent to the 22nd of October, when t3ix months\nfrom the defendant's first wife's death would have\nelapse 4.\nThe Lord Chief Justice summed up the case very\ncarefully to the jury, and pointed out to them the offer\nof the defendant to ' pay for cheap lodgings for the\nplaintiff until she could get a situation\u2014\" a very\nwithering change for one who expected to be his\nwife.\"\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014\nDamages, \u00a32OO.\n\nTHE KING OF PRUSSIA AND !lIS ARMY.\u2014The King\nof Prussia has issued the following order of the day to\nthe army The glorious war against Denmark is\nended.

It depenris upon the number of inem-bers,\nif the number of members were to drop, the society\nwould not have enough to meet that.\nDo you think that those who have the manage-\nment of that society have made any calculations\nwhatever, or have really considered for a moment\nwhat their position for the future might be P--No, I\ndo not remember it ever being mentioned.\nMr. Hughes: Suppose that the funeral fund had.\nfallen short in your time, what would have been\ndone in the society ?\u2014lt would have :been paid out\nof the trade fund, as long as the members kept\ntogether.\nSuppose that there was no trade fund, what would\nhave been done P\u2014They would have put a levy on\nthem, or they would have had to go without.\nDo you ever reinember a levy being put on for a\nspecial purpose in your society ?\u2014Yes, for trade pur-\nposes.\n\n-\n1 There never was any necessity in your time for a\nlevy for accident purposes P\u2014No, not for accident\npurposes.\nNor for funeral purposes P\n, the 3d.\n\n\u2014No, nothing beyond\n\nI wish to see whether there has ever been an\ninstance of the fund falling short, and how the ease\nhas been met if there has been. You say that if the\nfund had fallen short it would have been met by a\n'levy, but that in your time no levy ha 3 been neces-\nsary P\u2014The number of members la_ray time was\nnever less than 600 members, and Of course 600\n\u2022 -I:pall M.34,-each cleared it.\nEarl of Lichfield At the tini(that you are\nstaking of, at what age were.-- your members\n_tvritteci, had you any fixed age ?\u2014Yes, 18.\nThey\nAn\n\u2014Y\n\n-\"R\n\u2014Tt just depends upon the num\ntick together; perhaps after a strike\nnot be \u2022 many members that !_ would . sti\n\nsociety, a strike might upset the society and Mil\nonly a few in who would be receiving accident\nmoney. _ . _\n\nMr. Hughes: During your time the number of\nmembers have varied from 600 to 3,000 P\u2014Yes,\nthere are 5,000 now.\nHave they steadily increased in number P\u2014They\nhave never decreased to less than 600.\nBut have they ever been at one time 3,000 arid\nthen 2,500 afterwards, for instance P\u2014They have\ngot up to 1,200 and then got back to 600.\nSo that 600 men must have left at that time P\n\nThey went, of course, off the accident and the\nfuneral fund entirely F\u2014Out of the trade entirely;\nthey went away andibecame non-soeiety men.\nThey would no longer have any claim on the\nfunds of the society P\u2014No. Then since Locket went\naway with that \u00a31,300 they altered the initiation\nmoney, that is to say, they took members in for less\nmoney.

The ecclesiastical revenues of that\ncountry being applied to purposes calculated to\npromote its secular interests ;\" and, in his excellent\nspeech in support of that view, took occasion to say,\nthat \"As regarded the application of the funds of\nthe Irish Church, he had a proposition to make\nwhich he did not think had been previously sug-\ngested. In Ireland they had millions of acres of\nland at present unclaimed, and it would be a prac-\ntical proposition to devote the funds of the Irish\nChurch to the purposes of reclaiming these waste\nlauds. The land so reclaimed to be let direct from\nthe Crown, and they would get a peasant proprietary\nin Ireland who would have a direct interest in their\nloyalty.\"\nThe Rev. Mr. Doxey said, \"The suggestion of\nMr. iones was a most practical one, which they\nmight present to the Rouse of Commons, because it\noffered some solution of the land question.\" Well\ndone, Mr. Jones and Mr. Doxey. The ball begins\nto move in the right direction, and may it roll\nonward to its final goal, is my most ardent wish.\nWhat, however, seems to me somewhat singular\nand amusing is, that the Rev. C. Neville and Mr.\nT. Dunning are reported as taking part in a meeting\nwhere such a \"dreamy\" and \"impracticable\" sug-\ngestion as \"letting the land direct from the crown\"\nis said to have been received with such favour.\n\nI wonder whether these two gentlemen fled from\nthe meeting in dismay when the idea of \"holding\nland direct from the crown \".was suggested, which,\nin other words, simply means the state; or whether\nthey retired into a corner of the room in a state of\nalarm for the fate of their adopted child\u2014land-\nlordism. The fact that men of education and high\nattainments were absolutely \"dreaming\" about\n\"letting land direct from the crown\" instead of\nselling it to the men with the money bags. I sin-\ncerely hope it had as happy an effect upon these two\ngentlemen as it appears to have had upon the\nmeeting.\nz . \u2022 ..\n\nI als-o c\/ommend to the serious attention of Mr.\nStephenson, of Halifax, the excellent suggestion of\n3-fr. c 1.1-=.4 above ineetintr. T havn pd_set\nbeen able to learn that gentleman's views upon the\nland question from anything he has written, but if\nhe approves the doctrine of Mr. John Stuart Mill,\nwhich he quotes, namely :\u2014\" That the claims of the\nlandlords to the land must be, and always is, subor-\ndinate to the general policy of the state,\" I have\ngood hopes of him.\nIn conclusion, I beg to say that if avik.Dublic\nmeetingtan be got upon the subject the begi fling\nof the new year, as suggested in last week's\nBEEHIVE, I shall be most happy to attend it, and\nso far as possible promote the objects of the meet-\ning. _ ALFRED A.

Having seen a balance-sheet of\nthe Reform Fete and Banquet in your edition of last\nSaturday, I most distinctly deny being indebted to\nthe committee at all; in fact, it is the other way,\nfor they are indebted to me for wages due, and\nwhich never yet have been settled. And in respect\n, to the receipt held by Mr. Murray from me, it is the\nsame as every other receipt given, and is entered in\nthe book as such, and was checked by the auditors,\nif such you call them,: for I am perfectly satisfied\nthey know as much about the accounts now as they\ndid before ever seeing' then. If that is not the case,\nwhy have they not published the whole of the de-\nfaulters; or perhaps they thought it much easier to\n, put it all on to me, whom they rEpresent as financial\nI secretary, but which .was never my position.

On\nThursday the deceased was eating his dinner, when he\nbegan to cough, and putting his hand before his mouth\nto prevent the meat he was masticating from corning\nout, in consequence of which a portion of it got into\nthe windpipe, and he died about three or four minutes\nafter.

As was generally expected, the thousands of men.\nemployed have accepted the reduction. It was generally\nagreed that if any resistance were offered on the part\nof the hands many establishments would he altogether\nclosed. Ten per cent. is to be the amount of the\nreduction, and all hands, with the exception of the col-\nliers, will have to submit to it. The colliers are\nexempted from it owing. to there being, a considerable\ndemand for . coal, more especially steam qualities for\nshipping purposes.\nHOLLOWAY'S PlLLs.\u2014The blood being the very essence\nof health and life, it is most essential it should be\nthoroughly purified before the depressing influences of\nwinter display themselves.

The ordinary coupling consists\nof draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws'\nso as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train\nclose together. There are also safety chains, one on\neach side of the main coupling. The improvement\ncomes into action the moment the engine or tender\nhappens to diverge at a certain angle from the line\nof railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of\ngear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are\ndriven back by the springs into the void left by the\ndraw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are\ninstantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame\nof the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com-\npletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears\nthat accidents from engines running off the rails amount\nto more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci-\ndents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the\nIst of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from\nthis cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas-\nsengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861\nthere were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas-\nsengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862\nthere were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and\n282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci-\ndents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail-\nway, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and\ninjury to 161 persons, making together in the course of\n3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running\noff the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63\npersons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons,\nbesides involving destruction of rolling stock and large\nsurna for compensation. This indicates to some extent\nthe advantage of adopting the system of coupling\npatented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia-\nment-street, and which appears to be very complete in\nevery respect for the purpose intended. It is in course\nof being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains\nen the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from\nthat cause have heretofore been rather more frequent\nthan on other railways A full-sized model of the\napparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament-\nstreet, which will enable those who are interested in\npreventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It\nis rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of\nrailways have no power to require the adoption of any\nimprovement that might appear to them calculatedito\nprevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although\nthey have power to prevent the opening of a railway\nfor traffic until all the requirements as to the stability\nof the works and the efficiency of the signals have been\nfully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the\nrailway department of the Board of Trade.\n\nANOTHER DANGEROUS FREAK OF A SAILOR.\u2014On the\nmorning of December 10, about four o'clock, as the mail\ntrain going north was, passing through Broughton, on\nthe Lancaster and Preston Railway., about a mile south\nof the Broughton and Barton Station, a sailor, a pas-\nal\nfull\nreipea geeds. , stepped out\nIle fell on\nos efn\nthe\ner i\ntrainu on one\nso of thew asee cgoingon dt\nclasse carriages,\nthe line, but fortunately received no further injuries\nthan slight bruises on one shoulder and, one knee. There\nwere three other sailors in the same compartment, and\nall of them having been partaking rather too freely of\ngrog, they had been fast asleep.. One of them awaken-\ning, being under the impression that he was at his\njourney's end, got up with the intention of alighting,\nand stepped out, but was surprised on finding himself\ncast to the ground with much force. On recovering\nfrom the shock of his fall, he saw the signal light off\nthe station at Barton ahead, and made his way thither,\nand related to the astonished station master his adven-\nture. He remained at the station about fourhours, until\nthe arrival of the next train which stopped there when\nhe was sent onwards. Except that no startling there,\nof\na Muller-like catastrophe followed the discovery of the\nsailor having fallen from the carriage, the incident is\nsomething like one which occurred on the London and\nNorth Western Railway, a few days ago, when a drunken\n' sailor fell out of the train when at full speed, and his\ncompanions were apprenended on the charge of murder,\nand were only released on their companion appearing in\npropria persona, and unhurt, to tell the Pile\u00b0 he had\nnot been murdered.\nTHE PEACE ADDRESS TO THE -UNITED STATBS.\nWashington dispatch says :\u2014About six weeks ago, Mr.\nJoseph Parker, of Manchester, England, arrived at\nNew York, bringing with him the peace address of the\nsubjects of Great Britain and Ireland, with a letter\nfrom Sir Henry de lloughton to Governor Seymour,\nwho declined formally to receive it, ;\nase.gning as a\nreason that it should be given to the President of the\nUnited States, the latter being the only authorised\nchannel of communication between other nations and\nthe citizens of the United States. Mr. Parker, having\narrived here last week, addressed a note to Secretary\nSeward, stating that he had been deputed to this coun-\ntry to convey the address to the people of the United\nStates, and asking the honour of an oPPertunity of\npresenting it to the President. To this the secretary\nreplied that, before answering the letter, it was desir-\nable to be further informed whether Mr. Parker had\nany authority from the Government of Great Britain\nand Ireland for the purpose referred to, and whether\nhis mission had been made known to the diplomatic\nagent of that government near the e\nbevernment of\nthe United States. Mr. Parker replied bY saying that\nthe address he had the honour of bringing to this\ncountry, containing the signatures. of 350,000 of his\ncountrymen, from the peer to the artisan, was not from\nthe Government of Great Britain, nor from any political\nparty. It was simply an expression of the earnest\ndesire of Great Britain to see Peace restored to this\ncountry. The correspondence closed by a note from\nthe Secretary of State, in which he said the Govern-\nment of the United States could not receive the\naddress, and that the request for an interview with the\nPresident was, therefore, declined. The intention now\nis to present the address to Congress at the approaching\nsession. \u2022\nMATTHEWS AND THE REWARD.\u2014.There is RO truth\nin the watement that Matthews has received the\nreward offered for the conviction of Muller. The\nrailway company and the bank have handed over their\nrespective sums to Sir Richard Mayne, and when\nGovernment have added their portiun, the question of\nhow the money should be divided will then come under\nconsideration. It is said, however, that it will be\nequally divided between Mr. Death; Matthews, and the\ntwo Repsches. Inspector Tanner will not, as is gene-\nrally supposed, Come in for any portion of the reward.\nIn fact, beyond his salary, there is no recognition of the\nservices rendered by this intelligent officer, and unless\nthe public think proper to accord him some mark of\ntheir approbation he will go unrewarded. \u2022\n\nBREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE.\nIn the Court of C..ommen- Pleason December 10, an\naction\u2014Wylie v. Baser was brought to recover\ndamages for breach of promis- of marriage. The de-\nfendant, by his plead', gs, denied the promise, anal\nalsl alleged that a roast) ,able time for the ,performanoe\nof the promise had not been a lowed.\nMr. Gitiard and Mr. rll.l,,chlan were for the plaintiff;\nMr. Phil brick for the defendant,\nMr. G.ffard said he oelieved he could fully establish\nboth the promise, and the refusal to perform it, and that\nthe only question for the jury would be the amount of\ndamages. The plaintiff, Mrs. Elizabeth Mary Wylie,\nwas a widow. The oefendant was a grocer at South\nNorwood. The plaintiff had for some time been employed\nas a housekeeper; and it was through the defendant\nbeing in want of a houskeeper that he first met Mrs.\nWylie. He was gre aly taken with her. They\nbecame intimate, and at length the defendant engaged\nto marry the plaintiff on Cioydan :Fair day. The\ndefendant was a widower, between 50 and 60 years of\nage, with a grown up family, and after having engaged\nhimself to the plaintiff he introduced her to his family,\nand afterwards gave her to understand that they were\ngreatly p'eased with her. The letters which he had\nwritten to her would clearly show the relation in which\nthey stood. The learned gentleman then read the\nfollowing letters addressed by the defendant to the\nplaintiff:\u2014\n\n\"5, Porthurl road, South Norwood,\nAugust 10, 1864.\n\"My dearest Mrs. W,\u2014l arrived home quite safe\nabout eleven o'clock last evening. lam very pleased\nto say that I feel all the better for my trip, but did not\nlike parting with you, and watched you as far as I\ncould see you, but could not get you to look back after\npoor me.

In another letter he said,\n\"I do not think it is possible for me to wait until the\nfair. lam so cold at nights that you must come and\nkeep me warm.\" (Laughter.) It would be unnecesSary\nto read more letters. He (Mr. Giflard) would show\nthat the defendant refused to perform the promise so dis-\ntinctly established by the correspondeace. The defen-\ndant had a good business, and would be able to pay\nsubstantial damages. The lady being'3B, it might be\nthought her feelings were less acute than those of a\nyoung maiden; but it may be considered that this was\npossibly her last chance. (Laughter.)\nMr. Greenwood, the plaintiff's attorney, was called,\nand stated that after his first letter on the subject of the\npromise the defendant called on him and said he could\nnot perform his promise, as his children thought the\nplaintiff too young for him. He would pay the expense\nof cheap lodgings for Mrs. Wylie until she got a situ-\nation. He wished to see the plaintiff privately, but\nhe (the witness) would only agree to this on condition\nthat the meeting took place at his own office. In his\nre-examination, he stated that his reason for this was\nthat the plaintiff had told him the defendant had be-\nhaved improperly to her when they were alone.\nMr. Philbrick then addressed the jury for the defend-\nant, and said that he should be able to satisfy them\nthat the plaintiff had conseeted to the marriage not\n\u2022 taking place until a later period than stated, and that\nthis action was brought too soon, as a reasonable time\nfor the marriage had not arrived when the action was\ncommenced.\nTwo witnesses were called, a tailor and his wife, of\nwhom the defendant had ordered the clothes he intended\nto be married in; but their evidence,: taken at the utmost\nvalue for the defendant, only fixed the event for some\nday subsequent to the 22nd of October, when t3ix months\nfrom the defendant's first wife's death would have\nelapse 4.\nThe Lord Chief Justice summed up the case very\ncarefully to the jury, and pointed out to them the offer\nof the defendant to ' pay for cheap lodgings for the\nplaintiff until she could get a situation\u2014\" a very\nwithering change for one who expected to be his\nwife.\"\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014\nDamages, \u00a32OO.\n\nTHE KING OF PRUSSIA AND !lIS ARMY.\u2014The King\nof Prussia has issued the following order of the day to\nthe army The glorious war against Denmark is\nended.

He never\nmakes a tour of inspection to see the law is\nobserved to prevent accidents; and, when sent\nfor by the men's fears, either notice is sent of\nhis coming, or some hint is given about the\ncomplaint, so that when a flying visit is made\nthere is nothing to see, and the men get a\nrebuke, or a discharge. Thus, the men object\nto report or complain of danger.

The ladies who have\nadopted this discriminative declaration should\ntake an interest in the cotton-growing coin-\npanics; accomplish their objects and earn\nfive per cent.; and larger dividends may be\nearned, which the shareholders, if they dislike\nthem, need not spend.\n\nDEATH IN THE PIT.-DITTIES OF\nINSPECTORS.\n\nr resume our remarks upon the subject of\nthe Edmund's Main Catastrophe, from last\nweek.\n\nThe fact is, in the South Yorkshire district,\nthe inspector is a known sympathiser with the\ninterests of capital. To him labour is but a\nthing with which the less law interferes to\nprotect the better. True to his politico-\neconomic creed, he gets as much salary and\ndoes as little for it as he can. He never visits a\npit when he dares to stop away. He never\nmakes a tour of inspection to see the law is\nobserved to prevent accidents; and, when sent\nfor by the men's fears, either notice is sent of\nhis coming, or some hint is given about the\ncomplaint, so that when a flying visit is made\nthere is nothing to see, and the men get a\nrebuke, or a discharge. Thus, the men object\nto report or complain of danger. 'There are\nscores of pits in Yorkshire that the -inspector\nhas never once been into; and hundreds of\nmen who neither know his face nor his address.\nThe inspector is bound to attend all inquests of\ndeath from accident's in pits held in this dis-\ntrict; he does not always do even that, or he\ncomes to view long after all traces of accident,\nor rather of the causes, are carefully removed.\nAnd the result is, whereas in the Factories' In- '\nspection Act, detection of breach of law before\naccidents, and of punishment accordingly, are '\nfrequent, under the Mines' Inspection Act\nbreaches of law before accidents are never\nheard of, and but very rarely convictions or\npunishment, when accidents have occurred,. that\nis, so far as employers are concerned. But\nwoe be to the poor miner who is either caught\nslipping, or if even the idea of a slip can be\ndetected. The- inspector then is truly a\nterror, and his wrath is something awful.\nHe carefully avticls having anything to do with\nthe men, and if a aeputation venture to seek\nan interview, he appoints his own house, per-\nhaps miles away, and therefore, practically, a\nbar to workmen going. And if even that be\ngot over, all that cold shoulder officialism, and\nthe most offensive red.tapeism, can show is\nshown. Formali*l4.,riect, ' and 'even\n_icule and nairgiffhe eWrience of parties\nwho have once sought his presence by appoint-\nment; and we leave the reader to judge whether\nan independent soul'd working man is likely\ntwice to submit to such treatment. We assure\nour readers that this, and worse; is the rule of\nthe conduct of Charles Merton, of St. John's,\nWakefield, Esquire, who, as a public officer, is\nwe submit, fairly open to criticism, as to his\npublic duty. And it is chien this way, to\nthe complete failure- of the Working of the\nInspectors' Act\u2014and herein,lies\n~the\nthat we attribute the fearful loss of li\nthat South ' Viire is subject to. The\nchief ' risk, that of life, is run by I\nmen; and it was to protect the men that tlke\nact, in. defiance of the opposition of the\nployers, was passed. But by the connivance\nof the Derby ministry, then in. power, and by\nthe efforts of J. C. Charlesworth, the chairman\nof the coal owners' associatAn, then M.P. for\nWakefield, it was referred to them to appoint\nthe inspectors. Of course they chose their\ninstill-Incas accordingly, and in this case the\nemployers have been most. fortunate in their\nselection. In Yorkshire, the act is worked to\nserve the employer; and the men suffer accor-\ndingly. Had the men their say in the appoint-\nment, (and we would ask if this is not as fair\nan interpretation of the object of the act, as\nthat the employers should rule the inspectors?)\nwe submit we should bear less of \" Barns-\nley Tragedies.\" Then the employers would\nhave tobe a little nifire attentive, and perhaps\na little more costly in their appliances, but it\nwould be true policy to enforce upon them.\nThe cost of these explosions is ruinous even to\nthe employers. And what is the 'reason the\nworking men have not their legitimate say, in\nthe measures vital to their own safety? The\nworkilig men are not, represented in the Com-\nmorm-House of Parliament--and the masters\nare. Working men ponder over that fact, 'and\nsee the censequences, even in the working of\nthe miner's act.. How long will labour endure '\nits burthens? when will it rise and assert its\nown rights and dignity? and put capital and\ninspectors in their true place, viz., as means to\nserve .humanity, and not to oppress and abuse?\nThe poor miner might then have length of days,\ninstead of the shortest life, and comfort and\nindependence, instead of pity and contempt.\nBut never as things are.\nA report of the coroner's inquest held on the\nWorsbro Dale tragedy has been published, and\nwe especially direct the attention of\nour readers to the facts elicited. It will be seen\nclearly that the fault of this misfortune is not\nwith the men. Blasting in a dangerous place\nis the certain cause of the explosion. Now\nwho caused the men to blast? So far as they\nwere concerned, the men proposed to wedge\nthe coal; but then such is the nature of the\nprices paid, that they could not live by wedg.\u2022\nmg. Then the pressure of the masters, and\nthe stimulus of extra pay, caused the men to\n","487350":"MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nSTAMP DUTY- ON PROBATES.\u2014By an Act jest passed,\n(27th and 281 h Viet., cap. 56), proaetes rind letters of\nadministration are exempted from sramp duty where\nthe effects do not exceea in value \u00a3lOO,\nINAUGURATION OF THE ALBERT STATUE AT PERTH\nBY THE QUEEN.\u2014We (Edinburgh, Courant) have pleasure\nin being able to announce that her Mak sty has graciously\nintimated her intent on to be present at the inauguration\nof the s'atue to the late Prince Consent on the North\nInch of Perth about the end of August.

The following are the particulars of the\naccident, so far as we have been able to learn :\u2014The\nmorning through goods train from Newcastle to Edin-\nburgh, consisting of an engine, 22 loaded trucks, and a\nguard's van, was approaching Falktone, about 17 miles\nfrom Riccarton, between 11 and 12 o'clock on Saturday,\nat a rate of about four miles an hour, when one of the\nsets of wheels went on to the rails le iding to a coil\nsiding., and the other set remained on the main line.\nAfter running for a very short distance, the eng'ne\nstarted entirely off the rails, and almost imme-\ndiately sunk in the ground. Toe impetus of\nthe heavy waggons behind forced the tender right\non to the top of the engine, and the consequence\nwas that Peter Young, the driver, and William\nMorris, the stoker,were crushed to death instantaneously.\nRobert Aitchison, the guard of the train, escaped\nunhurt. As soon as the accident took place information\nwas telegraphed to Elexham, from which terminus an\nengine was immediately dispatched. When the Hexham\nengine reached the scene of the accident a chain was\nattached between it and the tender above the other\nengine, and the tender was dragged on to the side of the\nline. Then the sad results of the catastrophe became\npainfully apparent. Young, the driver, was found stand-\ning with the steam handle in his hand, and this position\nwas the only clue to his identification, as his head\nhad been literally smashed flat by the fall of the\ntender upon it. The body of the stoker was found\nlying against the fire box, and it presented a most me-\nlancholy And fearful spectacle, one of the sides of the\nface having been almost entirely burnt off. Besides\nthe information sent to Hexham, a telegram was de-\nspatched to the headquarters at Edinburgh, whence a\nspecial train was immediately dispatched with some\nof the officials, besides a body of workmen from St.\nMargaret's, who took with them a crane to lift the\nengine. As soon as this train reached the spot the\ncrane was put in requisition, and the engine and tender\nwere lifted and conveyed to Riccarton. Peter Young,\nthe driver, was 38 years of age, and resided at Restal-\nrig, where he has lea a widow and three children to\nlament his untimely end. He had been about 15 years\nin the company's service, and bore an excellent cha-\nracter. William Morris, the stoker, was formerly a\ndriver on the Perth and Inverness Railway. He\nentered the service of the North British Company\nabout six weeks ago, and he was acting as stoker till he\nhad acquired a sufficient knowledge of the line to\nenable him to take the post of driver. He also was\nmarried, and has left a widow and two or three children\nin Inverness.\n\nMETROPOLITAN VISITING AND RELIEF ASSOCIATION.\n\u2014The Rev. I. J.

All hands were six days on board\nthe ship while it was waterlogged, without the possibility\nof getting any provisions beyond a few peas; and one\nlad actually died from starvation before help arrived.\nThe master and all the others have been since landed at\nthe island of Lessoe, whence intelligence of their plight\nwas telegraphed to the owner, Mr. Coverdale, of\nHartlepool, by the British consul at Frederickshaven.\n\n_\nDEATH OP TTILE FRENCH EMPEROR'S SECRETARY.\u2014\nM. Jean Frangois Constant Mocquard, Private Secretary\nof the Emperor Napoleon, and whose dangerous illness\nhas been known for some time, expired at his residence\nin Paris, on December 9. M. Mocquard was born in\n1791, at a time when the principles of the Revolution\nwere ripening to their outburst. His education was for\nthe diplomatic service, but he left this profession for the\nbar, and was an ardent partisan of the Napoleon dynasty.\nOn the fall of the Empire he fearlessly came forward as\nan advocate of the proscribed adherents of the exiled\nEmperor, but during the domination of the Bourbons\ndid not assume any prominent public position. After\nthe Revolution of 1848 he seized the opportunity, and\nagain appeared as the constant supporter of the Bona-\npartist claims and ambitious policy. With the success\nof that policy he was identified, and was rewarded with\nthe confidential post which he occupied near his Im-\nperial master. The funeral obsequies of M. Mocquard\ntook place on December 12. A large body of Ministers\nand persons of note were present. Marshal Vaillant\npronounced a funeral oration over the grave, in which\nhe recalled the fidelity of M. Mocquard to the Emperor.\nHe said that he had come to bring the last farewell of\nthe Sovereign from whom the deceased had so lately\nreceived a last embrace. M. de Lagueronniere also\nmade a speech, in which he paid a tribute to M.\nMocquard in the name of the Senate and the Press.\nNARROW ESCAPE OP GENERAL BUTLER.\u2014A Washing-\nton dispatch, of Nov. 28, says :\u2014\" As the steamer\nWebster was coming down James River yesterday,\nwhen near Hog Island, she discovered that the steamer\nGreyhound, General Butler's dispatch boat, was making\nsignals of distress. On nearing the Greyhound she was\nfound to be on fire. Generals Butler and Schenck and\nAdmiral Porter were on board the Greyhound, but the\nsteamer Pioneer came up and took them off. They\nwere afterwards transferred to the tug Columbus and\nconveyed to Fortress Monroe. The Webster took off\nthe crew and passengers. The Greyhound had been up\nto City Point, and was on her return when the accident\ntook place. General Butler and his friends were at\ndinner at the time. Suddenly the furnace doors blew\nopen and scattered the coals all over the floor, driving\nthe firemen and engineers from their rooms. The\nGreyhound was almost immediately enveloped in flames,\nand, notwithstanding every effort to save her, she was\nburned to the water's edge. Ten horses belonging to\nGeneral Butler and staff were burnt to death. Shortly\nbefore the accident, the Greyhound had received from\nthe steamer Cossack the army mail for General Butler's\ndepartment, which left Washington yesterday morning,\nand it is supposed to be lost.\"\n\nATTEMPT \u2014OF FEDERAL PRISONERS TO ESCAPE.\u2014On\nThursday last a serious attempt was made by the\nFederal prisoners confined at Salisbury, North Carolina,\nto escape, which was rapidly and effectually quieted at\nthe expense of considerable Yankee blood. It appears\nthat the plot had been formed among the prisoners (of\nwhom there are at Salisbury some 13,000) to overpower\nthe interior guard of the encampment, then break\nthrough the line of parapet guard, and after securing\nall the arms they could to march through Western\nNorth Carolina into Tennessee, and make good their\nescape. In the first part of their programme they\nsucceeded. The interior guard were soon overpowered,\nand two of the unfortunate men were killed while\nreAsting. They then attacked the parapet guard,\nwho fought bravely against the terrible odds until\nthe alarm had been fully communicated to the\ngarrison, and two pieces of artillery were thrown\ninto position bearing upon the encampment. Two\nof the parapet guard were killed in their gallant\ndefence. In good time the artillery opened, and after a\nfew raking discharges of grape and canister the insurrec-\ntionists cried out for mercy, and declared that they\nwould make no further effort to get away. By this time\nthey were completely surrounded with artillery and\ninfantry, and it is well for them that they ceased their\ndemonstration, lacl sued for mercy. In ten minutes\nmore the whole camp would have been one scene of\nslaughter. As it was, about forty were killed, and a\nlarge number wounded. Thus a very foolish attempt to\nescape from Confederate durance has ended. It will\nprove, no doubt, a lesson to prisoners in the South. But\nfor the coolness and, it may be added, the consideration\nof the officers commanding the garrison, the punishment\ninflicted upon these misguided captives would have been\nfar more serious, if indeed it had not amounted to the\nannihilation of the entire body.\u2014.Riclimona Enquirer,\nNov. 28.\n\nCOUPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT EXHIBITION\nBUILDING.\u2014On December 12 the complete demolition\nof the grand entrance to the Great Exhibition Building\nin the Cromwell road was accomplished by the Royal\nEngineers and Sappers an Miners, under Lieutenant\nKnocker.

The plaintiff was a Mr. Prudie, a clerk in\nthe Bank of England, and the defendant was a Mr.\nHopkinson, a bookmaker. Mr. Pearce, for the plaintiff,\nsaid that on the sth of September last a race for the\nchampionship of the Tyne and 400 was arranged\nbetween Chambers and Cooper. The plaintiff went to\na house frequented by the defendant, and made a bet\nwith him \u00a324 to \u00a3l6 on Cooper. When the men\nrowed a great deal of fouling ensued, and it was de-\nclared no race, all bets being off. The defendant wanted\nthe plaintiff to bet upon the second race but he refused,\nand demanded the \u00a324 of the defendant, with\nwhom it had been deposited. Defendant declined to give\nit up, and hence the action. Mr. Purdie said that, in\nconsequence of bets being declared off he demanded his\ndeposit back, but defendant, who is a betting man, said\nhe should wait for the final de-ision. Plaintiff objected\nto let the bet stand, and was called \"mean\" and\n\"paltry.\" Cross-examined: There is a rule in the\nBank of England, that no clerk shall use his money for\nbetting purposes. The money in this case was not his,\nbut belonged to parties in Newgate m ,rket and else-\nwhere. He was accustomed to bet for other people, and\nreceived a commission. Betted a good deal on boat-races,\nbut did not understand the law of horse-racing. Had\nbetted for people on horse-races. Thoroughly understood\nall about betting on boat-races, and had bet n on the river\nfor the last twonty years. Had known bets off when a\nfoul had taken place.

Mr. Salter said it was the 811 a and 9th\nVic,, cap. 109, and in sec. 18 it was expressly laid\ndown that no suit of the kind could be maintained.\nMr. Pearce said that upon the first objection he had\nnothing to answer, as the contract was between plaintiff\nand defendant; and as to the second, it was laid down\nin the case of Martin and Howson that the deposit\ncould be reclaimed before the event was decided. His\nlordship ruled that the learned counsel had not shown\nthat the event had not come off, and the absence of the\nreferee appeared to be fatal.

The\nentire exports are found to have been \u00a3927,000 more\nthan the amount stated in that volume, and the im-\nports \u00a362,000 less. The corrected statement of the trade\nof the year is as follows :\u2014The imports reached the\nunprecedented value of \u00a3248,919,020; the exports also\nwere of higher value than those of any previous year,\nthe exports of the produce of the -United Kingdom\namounting to \u00a3146,602,342, and of foreign and colonial\nproduce to \u00a350,300,067, making together \u00a3196,902,409.\nThe total value, therefore of the imports and exports\nof the year was \u00a3445,821,429. In no previous year\ndid the amount come within \u00a350,000,000 of this enor-\nmous total.\n\nTREESMOST AFFECTED EY LIGHTNING. - Fig trees\nand cedars are rarely struck by lightning; the beech,\nlarch, fir, and chesnut are obnoxious to it; but the\ntrees whish attract it most are the oak, yew, and Lom-\nbardy poplar.

The cure had frequently given her\nToney, and his neglect to answer recent begging letters\nwas the cause of the crime.\nCOLLISION ow THE GREENWICH LINE.\u2014On Dec 19,\nan accident occurred on the Greenwich line, and, like\nthe one in Blackheath tunnel, through a failure in the\nsignalling. The scene of this fresh accident was the\njunction where the Greenwich line diverges a short\ndis`ance from New Cross, at which spot, shortly before\neight o'clock, an engine was on the up-line preparing to\nrun on the metals of the North Sent line, when the\npassenger train from Greenwich came up, and a collision\nwas the consequence. The driver and stoker of the\npassenger train were much injured, as were some of the\npassengers, and it was rumoured that one of the two\nmen on the other engine was killed. The extent of the\naccident cannot, however, be learnt, for the company's\nservants refuse to give any information, and the public\nhave to choose between two stories\u2014one that twenty\npeople were seriously injured, the other that only a few\npersons were bruised. The driver and stoker of the\npassenger train were conveyed to Guy's Hospital. The\ncause of this accident is stated to have \u2022arisen from the\nsignal \"All clear\" being given at the last point which\nthe passenger train passed, and the driver was proceed-\ning in perfect security through a dense fog which then\nprevailed until the very moment when the train came\ninto collision with the engine. The traffic was resumed\nsoon after the accident.\nVERDICT OF MANSLAUGHTER AGAINST A CHEMIST.\u2014\nThe inquest on Mr. Samuel Crowther, photographer, '\nand his son, who were killed by an explosion while the\nformer was manufacturing gas from manganese and\nchlorate of potass, on Dgcember 17, has taken place.\nThe evidence was to the effect that he was making the\ngas for Mr. Morgan, optician, when the explosion took\nplaced, the manganese he was using being obtained\nfrom Mr. Hughes, a chemist. Professor Roscoe had\nexamined this manganese, and, according to his evi-\ndence, it contained 25 per cent. of pulverized coal or\nsoot, which he said would render the mixture of the\nmanganese with chlorate of potass as\u2022dangerous as gun-\npowder. The jury found a verdict of \"Manslaughter\nagainst Mr. Hughes,\" and Mr. Herford, the coroner,\ncommitted him for trial, but afterwards admitted him to\nbail.\n\nA LIIMRAL EMPLOYER.\u2014M. Dolfus, the well-known\nmanufacturer, of Mulhausen, being struck with the\nheavy rate of mortality among the infant children of\nwomen working in his factory, some time back intro-\nduced a regulation allowing women during their con-\nfinement six weeks' leave of absence, without any\nsuspension of wages, in order that they might afford\nto their infants the necessary attention. 'I he experi-\nment has been highly successful, as the mortality at\nonce fell from 36 to 25 per cent. The loss to the\nfactory during the year from this liberal measure has\nbeen B,ooof. Several other manufacturers of the same\ntown have followed M. Dolfus's example. _ _\n\nANGLESEA CENTRAL RAILWAY.\u2014TiIe first section of\nthe new line of railway from Gaerwen to Llangefin has;\nbeen formally opened, though passenger traffic will not\npass over it until January next. The line commences\nby a junction with the Chester and Holyhead at a point\nnear Gaerwen Station, and, passing through the Berw\ncoalfield and across the Malltraeth Marsh, reaches\nLlangefin, at a distance of four miles and a half. The\nremaining distance of thirteen and a half miles from\nLla.ngefin to Amlwch, the heaviest works of which are\nalready far advanced, will, it is expected, be ready for\nopening by the end of September next.\nAN ACTION FOR THE Loss OF A SPORTING DOG.\u2014\nAt the Lord Mayor's Court an action, \" Ruskin v. Gale,\"\nwas tried to recover the value of a sporting dog. Mr.\nPhilbrick was for the plaintiff, and Mr. H. James for\nthe defendant. The parties to the action were intimate\nfriends, and one lent the other his dog, which was lost\nthrough the negligence of the defendant. It was,\nhow ever, proved by a domestic in the service of the\ndefendant that she fastened the door when the dustmen\ncame, but the dog disappeared, and had not been found,\nalthough expenses amounting to \u00a31 4s. 6d. had been\nincurred in advertisements, placards, and cab hire. The\nadvertisements and bill amounted to 16s. 6d. The\nlearned Recorder, in placing the case before the jury\nregretted that such an action had. been brought. In\norder to find for the value of the dog (\u00a35) the jury must\nbe satisfied that it was lost through negligence. The\njury found for the plaintiff for 18s. 6d., for the adver-\ntisements and placards.\nDEATH OF A CHILD FROM SWALLOWING HOOKS.\u2014Mr.\nRichards, deputy coroner, held an inquest recently at\nHackney respecting the death of Sarah Holmes, a child\naged two years. The evidence showed that the de-\nceased, while playing with Rther children in a room\nwhere her mother (a dressmaller) was working, picked\nup two hooks and put them in her mouth. suddenly\nshe called out that she had swallowed them, and that\nthey stuck in her throat. Her mother gave her some-\nthing to eat, thinking that would cause the hooks to\npass into the stomach. S.tiDsequently the throat became\nswollen, and inflammation of the windpipe soon fol-\nlowed, and caused the child's death. A verdict of\n\"Accidental death\" was returned.\nMYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE AND DEATH.

Robert Geo. Milne,\nan Independent minister, formerly in charge of a con-\ngregation at Tintwistle, but now residing at South-\nport, sued the London and North-Western Railway\nCompany for damages in consequence of a railway\naccident. The case was a very peauliar one. The\naccident took place at Copley Hill, Leeds, so far back\nas Oct. 16, 1867, but it was not till November, 1863,\nthat plaintiff was permanently disabled. In the\nmeantime he had been engaged as local secretary of\nthe British and Foreign Bible Society at a salary of\n\u00a33OO per year, and travelled, about the country, de-\nlivering addresses on its behalf. On November 12,\n1863, thirteen months after the accident, he had a\nparalytic attack which rendered him so complete a\nwreck that his evidence had to be taken by commis-\nsion. The question in dispute was -whether the\nparalysis resulted from the accident. The defendants\ncontended that it was too remote from the time of the\ncollision to have been caused by it, and the fact that\nthe plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel\nabout the country and deliver addresses, night after\nnight, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible\nSociety, was relied on in proof of this. On the other\nside it was maintained that from the time of the acci-\ndent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the\nfinal seizure, and that there was a continuity of\nsymptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were\ncalled on each side who directly contradicted each\nother as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The\njudge, in summing up, said the plaintiff. was clearly\nentitled to damages for the sufferings he had under-\ngone since the time of the accident, but he could give\nno assistance as to the real point at issue.

The ordinary coupling consists\nof draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws'\nso as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train\nclose together. There are also safety chains, one on\neach side of the main coupling. The improvement\ncomes into action the moment the engine or tender\nhappens to diverge at a certain angle from the line\nof railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of\ngear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are\ndriven back by the springs into the void left by the\ndraw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are\ninstantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame\nof the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com-\npletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears\nthat accidents from engines running off the rails amount\nto more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci-\ndents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the\nIst of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from\nthis cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas-\nsengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861\nthere were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas-\nsengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862\nthere were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and\n282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci-\ndents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail-\nway, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and\ninjury to 161 persons, making together in the course of\n3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running\noff the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63\npersons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons,\nbesides involving destruction of rolling stock and large\nsurna for compensation. This indicates to some extent\nthe advantage of adopting the system of coupling\npatented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia-\nment-street, and which appears to be very complete in\nevery respect for the purpose intended. It is in course\nof being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains\nen the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from\nthat cause have heretofore been rather more frequent\nthan on other railways A full-sized model of the\napparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament-\nstreet, which will enable those who are interested in\npreventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It\nis rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of\nrailways have no power to require the adoption of any\nimprovement that might appear to them calculatedito\nprevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although\nthey have power to prevent the opening of a railway\nfor traffic until all the requirements as to the stability\nof the works and the efficiency of the signals have been\nfully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the\nrailway department of the Board of Trade.\n\nANOTHER DANGEROUS FREAK OF A SAILOR.\u2014On the\nmorning of December 10, about four o'clock, as the mail\ntrain going north was, passing through Broughton, on\nthe Lancaster and Preston Railway., about a mile south\nof the Broughton and Barton Station, a sailor, a pas-\nal\nfull\nreipea geeds. , stepped out\nIle fell on\nos efn\nthe\ner i\ntrainu on one\nso of thew asee cgoingon dt\nclasse carriages,\nthe line, but fortunately received no further injuries\nthan slight bruises on one shoulder and, one knee. There\nwere three other sailors in the same compartment, and\nall of them having been partaking rather too freely of\ngrog, they had been fast asleep.. One of them awaken-\ning, being under the impression that he was at his\njourney's end, got up with the intention of alighting,\nand stepped out, but was surprised on finding himself\ncast to the ground with much force. On recovering\nfrom the shock of his fall, he saw the signal light off\nthe station at Barton ahead, and made his way thither,\nand related to the astonished station master his adven-\nture. He remained at the station about fourhours, until\nthe arrival of the next train which stopped there when\nhe was sent onwards. Except that no startling there,\nof\na Muller-like catastrophe followed the discovery of the\nsailor having fallen from the carriage, the incident is\nsomething like one which occurred on the London and\nNorth Western Railway, a few days ago, when a drunken\n' sailor fell out of the train when at full speed, and his\ncompanions were apprenended on the charge of murder,\nand were only released on their companion appearing in\npropria persona, and unhurt, to tell the Pile\u00b0 he had\nnot been murdered.\nTHE PEACE ADDRESS TO THE -UNITED STATBS.\nWashington dispatch says :\u2014About six weeks ago, Mr.\nJoseph Parker, of Manchester, England, arrived at\nNew York, bringing with him the peace address of the\nsubjects of Great Britain and Ireland, with a letter\nfrom Sir Henry de lloughton to Governor Seymour,\nwho declined formally to receive it, ;\nase.gning as a\nreason that it should be given to the President of the\nUnited States, the latter being the only authorised\nchannel of communication between other nations and\nthe citizens of the United States. Mr. Parker, having\narrived here last week, addressed a note to Secretary\nSeward, stating that he had been deputed to this coun-\ntry to convey the address to the people of the United\nStates, and asking the honour of an oPPertunity of\npresenting it to the President. To this the secretary\nreplied that, before answering the letter, it was desir-\nable to be further informed whether Mr. Parker had\nany authority from the Government of Great Britain\nand Ireland for the purpose referred to, and whether\nhis mission had been made known to the diplomatic\nagent of that government near the e\nbevernment of\nthe United States. Mr. Parker replied bY saying that\nthe address he had the honour of bringing to this\ncountry, containing the signatures. of 350,000 of his\ncountrymen, from the peer to the artisan, was not from\nthe Government of Great Britain, nor from any political\nparty. It was simply an expression of the earnest\ndesire of Great Britain to see Peace restored to this\ncountry. The correspondence closed by a note from\nthe Secretary of State, in which he said the Govern-\nment of the United States could not receive the\naddress, and that the request for an interview with the\nPresident was, therefore, declined. The intention now\nis to present the address to Congress at the approaching\nsession. \u2022\nMATTHEWS AND THE REWARD.\u2014.There is RO truth\nin the watement that Matthews has received the\nreward offered for the conviction of Muller. The\nrailway company and the bank have handed over their\nrespective sums to Sir Richard Mayne, and when\nGovernment have added their portiun, the question of\nhow the money should be divided will then come under\nconsideration. It is said, however, that it will be\nequally divided between Mr. Death; Matthews, and the\ntwo Repsches. Inspector Tanner will not, as is gene-\nrally supposed, Come in for any portion of the reward.\nIn fact, beyond his salary, there is no recognition of the\nservices rendered by this intelligent officer, and unless\nthe public think proper to accord him some mark of\ntheir approbation he will go unrewarded. \u2022\n\nBREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE.\nIn the Court of C..ommen- Pleason December 10, an\naction\u2014Wylie v. Baser was brought to recover\ndamages for breach of promis- of marriage. The de-\nfendant, by his plead', gs, denied the promise, anal\nalsl alleged that a roast) ,able time for the ,performanoe\nof the promise had not been a lowed.\nMr. Gitiard and Mr. rll.l,,chlan were for the plaintiff;\nMr. Phil brick for the defendant,\nMr. G.ffard said he oelieved he could fully establish\nboth the promise, and the refusal to perform it, and that\nthe only question for the jury would be the amount of\ndamages. The plaintiff, Mrs. Elizabeth Mary Wylie,\nwas a widow. The oefendant was a grocer at South\nNorwood. The plaintiff had for some time been employed\nas a housekeeper; and it was through the defendant\nbeing in want of a houskeeper that he first met Mrs.\nWylie. He was gre aly taken with her. They\nbecame intimate, and at length the defendant engaged\nto marry the plaintiff on Cioydan :Fair day. The\ndefendant was a widower, between 50 and 60 years of\nage, with a grown up family, and after having engaged\nhimself to the plaintiff he introduced her to his family,\nand afterwards gave her to understand that they were\ngreatly p'eased with her. The letters which he had\nwritten to her would clearly show the relation in which\nthey stood. The learned gentleman then read the\nfollowing letters addressed by the defendant to the\nplaintiff:\u2014\n\n\"5, Porthurl road, South Norwood,\nAugust 10, 1864.\n\"My dearest Mrs. W,\u2014l arrived home quite safe\nabout eleven o'clock last evening. lam very pleased\nto say that I feel all the better for my trip, but did not\nlike parting with you, and watched you as far as I\ncould see you, but could not get you to look back after\npoor me.

I shall soon\nhear what he reports at home. He so regrets that his\nwife was not with him. I wish she had. I hope it\nwill not be long before Fre all meet, and pleasantly. I\nhope. I told him it was all arranged\u2014we were going\nto be married after a eertain time had elapsed; and he\nthinks I am quite right in pleasing myself, which he\nknows I shall do.

I do so wish I was\ngoing to be with you; I think that would cure me\nquite. Now, my dear, I cannot tell you what an\nimpression Mr. Kemp has made on my family; they\nare all so anxious to see you. He tells all my friends\nwhat a nice little body I have found, but he ,still\nwonders where I found you. I got censured for leaving\nyou that unlucky Tuesday as I did, and wanted to know\nhow I could behave so rude to, you: So, after all this,\nI shall be so happy to introduce you to my daughter;\nbut shasays shetwould rather see you first at her house,\nwhich I shall arrange. Ycu will,, my dear, quite\nunderstand how necessary; perhaps if she met you at\nmy house first, it would be too much for her. I was in\nLondon when your letter arrived this morning.

You will come by the train which\nleaves Victoria at 12.12, and I will meet you.--I am,\nmy dearest little pet, your own most affectionate\n\"W.\nIn a subsequent letter, Mr. Giffard continued, the de-\nfendant advised the plaintiff to go to Newington Church,\nand then she heard the banns proclaimed between\nherself and the defendant. In another letter he said,\n\"I do not think it is possible for me to wait until the\nfair. lam so cold at nights that you must come and\nkeep me warm.\" (Laughter.) It would be unnecesSary\nto read more letters. He (Mr. Giflard) would show\nthat the defendant refused to perform the promise so dis-\ntinctly established by the correspondeace. The defen-\ndant had a good business, and would be able to pay\nsubstantial damages. The lady being'3B, it might be\nthought her feelings were less acute than those of a\nyoung maiden; but it may be considered that this was\npossibly her last chance. (Laughter.)\nMr. Greenwood, the plaintiff's attorney, was called,\nand stated that after his first letter on the subject of the\npromise the defendant called on him and said he could\nnot perform his promise, as his children thought the\nplaintiff too young for him. He would pay the expense\nof cheap lodgings for Mrs. Wylie until she got a situ-\nation. He wished to see the plaintiff privately, but\nhe (the witness) would only agree to this on condition\nthat the meeting took place at his own office. In his\nre-examination, he stated that his reason for this was\nthat the plaintiff had told him the defendant had be-\nhaved improperly to her when they were alone.\nMr. Philbrick then addressed the jury for the defend-\nant, and said that he should be able to satisfy them\nthat the plaintiff had conseeted to the marriage not\n\u2022 taking place until a later period than stated, and that\nthis action was brought too soon, as a reasonable time\nfor the marriage had not arrived when the action was\ncommenced.\nTwo witnesses were called, a tailor and his wife, of\nwhom the defendant had ordered the clothes he intended\nto be married in; but their evidence,: taken at the utmost\nvalue for the defendant, only fixed the event for some\nday subsequent to the 22nd of October, when t3ix months\nfrom the defendant's first wife's death would have\nelapse 4.\nThe Lord Chief Justice summed up the case very\ncarefully to the jury, and pointed out to them the offer\nof the defendant to ' pay for cheap lodgings for the\nplaintiff until she could get a situation\u2014\" a very\nwithering change for one who expected to be his\nwife.\"\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014\nDamages, \u00a32OO.\n\nTHE KING OF PRUSSIA AND !lIS ARMY.\u2014The King\nof Prussia has issued the following order of the day to\nthe army The glorious war against Denmark is\nended.

The main roads northward from this\nbarrier lead to Flensburg through Oversee, and along\nthis line, chased by the Austrians, it would appear, and\noutflanked by the Prussians, the forlorn hope of Den-\nmark has withdrawn, marking its retreat by skirmishes\nand battles. It would seem that the allies have divided\nthe task of annihilating or paralysing their opponents\u2014\nthe troops of Vienna undertaking to drive them towards\nJutland and the E tst Sea or Baltic, while those of\nBerlin head them and cut them off from the first-men-\ntioned refuge. Along all this terrible and saddening track\nthe Dews, like hunted lions, have turned again and\nagain upon their pursuers, and made them pay dear in\nblood for their tr:umph. Idstedt and Oversee have thus\nbeen signalised with engagements, as well as Ban and\nKupfermuhle, if it has not been rather a running fight\nalong the entire line of retreat. At Flensburg, where\nwe last find the Austrians, they had come among a popu-\nlation no longer friendly to Germans and the Augusten-\nburg. The inhabitants of this town, which stands on a\nfiord of the same name, are reported to have thrown up\nbarricades in the streets, and to have received the\ninvaders with a fire of musketry so deadly that\n1,100 of the allies were killed and wounded be-\nfore the town was taken. This statement rests\nupon the tales of deserters from the Danish army.\nThe same report leads us to believe that the plan of\ncutting off the army from Jutland has succeeded, for it is\ndeclared that the Danes have turned aside from Flens-\nburg, somewhere to the south of Apenrade, and sought\nsanctuary in their old place of refuge, the island of\nAlsen. S\u2022hould this be true, the former war bits repeated\nitself over and over again in the new one; iar it was of\nAlsen that Denmark made a fortress against Prussia,\nwhet-. Austria, instead of being her enemy, was her\nfriend.

The ordinary coupling consists\nof draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws'\nso as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train\nclose together. There are also safety chains, one on\neach side of the main coupling. The improvement\ncomes into action the moment the engine or tender\nhappens to diverge at a certain angle from the line\nof railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of\ngear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are\ndriven back by the springs into the void left by the\ndraw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are\ninstantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame\nof the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com-\npletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears\nthat accidents from engines running off the rails amount\nto more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci-\ndents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the\nIst of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from\nthis cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas-\nsengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861\nthere were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas-\nsengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862\nthere were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and\n282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci-\ndents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail-\nway, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and\ninjury to 161 persons, making together in the course of\n3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running\noff the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63\npersons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons,\nbesides involving destruction of rolling stock and large\nsurna for compensation. This indicates to some extent\nthe advantage of adopting the system of coupling\npatented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia-\nment-street, and which appears to be very complete in\nevery respect for the purpose intended. It is in course\nof being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains\nen the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from\nthat cause have heretofore been rather more frequent\nthan on other railways A full-sized model of the\napparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament-\nstreet, which will enable those who are interested in\npreventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It\nis rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of\nrailways have no power to require the adoption of any\nimprovement that might appear to them calculatedito\nprevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although\nthey have power to prevent the opening of a railway\nfor traffic until all the requirements as to the stability\nof the works and the efficiency of the signals have been\nfully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the\nrailway department of the Board of Trade.\n\nANOTHER DANGEROUS FREAK OF A SAILOR.\u2014On the\nmorning of December 10, about four o'clock, as the mail\ntrain going north was, passing through Broughton, on\nthe Lancaster and Preston Railway., about a mile south\nof the Broughton and Barton Station, a sailor, a pas-\nal\nfull\nreipea geeds. , stepped out\nIle fell on\nos efn\nthe\ner i\ntrainu on one\nso of thew asee cgoingon dt\nclasse carriages,\nthe line, but fortunately received no further injuries\nthan slight bruises on one shoulder and, one knee. There\nwere three other sailors in the same compartment, and\nall of them having been partaking rather too freely of\ngrog, they had been fast asleep.. One of them awaken-\ning, being under the impression that he was at his\njourney's end, got up with the intention of alighting,\nand stepped out, but was surprised on finding himself\ncast to the ground with much force. On recovering\nfrom the shock of his fall, he saw the signal light off\nthe station at Barton ahead, and made his way thither,\nand related to the astonished station master his adven-\nture. He remained at the station about fourhours, until\nthe arrival of the next train which stopped there when\nhe was sent onwards. Except that no startling there,\nof\na Muller-like catastrophe followed the discovery of the\nsailor having fallen from the carriage, the incident is\nsomething like one which occurred on the London and\nNorth Western Railway, a few days ago, when a drunken\n' sailor fell out of the train when at full speed, and his\ncompanions were apprenended on the charge of murder,\nand were only released on their companion appearing in\npropria persona, and unhurt, to tell the Pile\u00b0 he had\nnot been murdered.\nTHE PEACE ADDRESS TO THE -UNITED STATBS.\nWashington dispatch says :\u2014About six weeks ago, Mr.\nJoseph Parker, of Manchester, England, arrived at\nNew York, bringing with him the peace address of the\nsubjects of Great Britain and Ireland, with a letter\nfrom Sir Henry de lloughton to Governor Seymour,\nwho declined formally to receive it, ;\nase.gning as a\nreason that it should be given to the President of the\nUnited States, the latter being the only authorised\nchannel of communication between other nations and\nthe citizens of the United States. Mr. Parker, having\narrived here last week, addressed a note to Secretary\nSeward, stating that he had been deputed to this coun-\ntry to convey the address to the people of the United\nStates, and asking the honour of an oPPertunity of\npresenting it to the President. To this the secretary\nreplied that, before answering the letter, it was desir-\nable to be further informed whether Mr. Parker had\nany authority from the Government of Great Britain\nand Ireland for the purpose referred to, and whether\nhis mission had been made known to the diplomatic\nagent of that government near the e\nbevernment of\nthe United States. Mr. Parker replied bY saying that\nthe address he had the honour of bringing to this\ncountry, containing the signatures. of 350,000 of his\ncountrymen, from the peer to the artisan, was not from\nthe Government of Great Britain, nor from any political\nparty. It was simply an expression of the earnest\ndesire of Great Britain to see Peace restored to this\ncountry. The correspondence closed by a note from\nthe Secretary of State, in which he said the Govern-\nment of the United States could not receive the\naddress, and that the request for an interview with the\nPresident was, therefore, declined. The intention now\nis to present the address to Congress at the approaching\nsession. \u2022\nMATTHEWS AND THE REWARD.\u2014.There is RO truth\nin the watement that Matthews has received the\nreward offered for the conviction of Muller. The\nrailway company and the bank have handed over their\nrespective sums to Sir Richard Mayne, and when\nGovernment have added their portiun, the question of\nhow the money should be divided will then come under\nconsideration. It is said, however, that it will be\nequally divided between Mr. Death; Matthews, and the\ntwo Repsches. Inspector Tanner will not, as is gene-\nrally supposed, Come in for any portion of the reward.\nIn fact, beyond his salary, there is no recognition of the\nservices rendered by this intelligent officer, and unless\nthe public think proper to accord him some mark of\ntheir approbation he will go unrewarded. \u2022\n\nBREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE.\nIn the Court of C..ommen- Pleason December 10, an\naction\u2014Wylie v.

The de-\nfendant, by his plead', gs, denied the promise, anal\nalsl alleged that a roast) ,able time for the ,performanoe\nof the promise had not been a lowed.\nMr. Gitiard and Mr. rll.l,,chlan were for the plaintiff;\nMr. Phil brick for the defendant,\nMr. G.ffard said he oelieved he could fully establish\nboth the promise, and the refusal to perform it, and that\nthe only question for the jury would be the amount of\ndamages. The plaintiff, Mrs. Elizabeth Mary Wylie,\nwas a widow. The oefendant was a grocer at South\nNorwood. The plaintiff had for some time been employed\nas a housekeeper; and it was through the defendant\nbeing in want of a houskeeper that he first met Mrs.\nWylie. He was gre aly taken with her. They\nbecame intimate, and at length the defendant engaged\nto marry the plaintiff on Cioydan :Fair day. The\ndefendant was a widower, between 50 and 60 years of\nage, with a grown up family, and after having engaged\nhimself to the plaintiff he introduced her to his family,\nand afterwards gave her to understand that they were\ngreatly p'eased with her. The letters which he had\nwritten to her would clearly show the relation in which\nthey stood. The learned gentleman then read the\nfollowing letters addressed by the defendant to the\nplaintiff:\u2014\n\n\"5, Porthurl road, South Norwood,\nAugust 10, 1864.\n\"My dearest Mrs. W,\u2014l arrived home quite safe\nabout eleven o'clock last evening. lam very pleased\nto say that I feel all the better for my trip, but did not\nlike parting with you, and watched you as far as I\ncould see you, but could not get you to look back after\npoor me.

I do so wish I was\ngoing to be with you; I think that would cure me\nquite. Now, my dear, I cannot tell you what an\nimpression Mr. Kemp has made on my family; they\nare all so anxious to see you. He tells all my friends\nwhat a nice little body I have found, but he ,still\nwonders where I found you. I got censured for leaving\nyou that unlucky Tuesday as I did, and wanted to know\nhow I could behave so rude to, you: So, after all this,\nI shall be so happy to introduce you to my daughter;\nbut shasays shetwould rather see you first at her house,\nwhich I shall arrange. Ycu will,, my dear, quite\nunderstand how necessary; perhaps if she met you at\nmy house first, it would be too much for her. I was in\nLondon when your letter arrived this morning.

You will come by the train which\nleaves Victoria at 12.12, and I will meet you.--I am,\nmy dearest little pet, your own most affectionate\n\"W.\nIn a subsequent letter, Mr. Giffard continued, the de-\nfendant advised the plaintiff to go to Newington Church,\nand then she heard the banns proclaimed between\nherself and the defendant. In another letter he said,\n\"I do not think it is possible for me to wait until the\nfair. lam so cold at nights that you must come and\nkeep me warm.\" (Laughter.) It would be unnecesSary\nto read more letters. He (Mr. Giflard) would show\nthat the defendant refused to perform the promise so dis-\ntinctly established by the correspondeace. The defen-\ndant had a good business, and would be able to pay\nsubstantial damages. The lady being'3B, it might be\nthought her feelings were less acute than those of a\nyoung maiden; but it may be considered that this was\npossibly her last chance. (Laughter.)\nMr. Greenwood, the plaintiff's attorney, was called,\nand stated that after his first letter on the subject of the\npromise the defendant called on him and said he could\nnot perform his promise, as his children thought the\nplaintiff too young for him. He would pay the expense\nof cheap lodgings for Mrs. Wylie until she got a situ-\nation. He wished to see the plaintiff privately, but\nhe (the witness) would only agree to this on condition\nthat the meeting took place at his own office. In his\nre-examination, he stated that his reason for this was\nthat the plaintiff had told him the defendant had be-\nhaved improperly to her when they were alone.\nMr. Philbrick then addressed the jury for the defend-\nant, and said that he should be able to satisfy them\nthat the plaintiff had conseeted to the marriage not\n\u2022 taking place until a later period than stated, and that\nthis action was brought too soon, as a reasonable time\nfor the marriage had not arrived when the action was\ncommenced.\nTwo witnesses were called, a tailor and his wife, of\nwhom the defendant had ordered the clothes he intended\nto be married in; but their evidence,: taken at the utmost\nvalue for the defendant, only fixed the event for some\nday subsequent to the 22nd of October, when t3ix months\nfrom the defendant's first wife's death would have\nelapse 4.\nThe Lord Chief Justice summed up the case very\ncarefully to the jury, and pointed out to them the offer\nof the defendant to ' pay for cheap lodgings for the\nplaintiff until she could get a situation\u2014\" a very\nwithering change for one who expected to be his\nwife.\"\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014\nDamages, \u00a32OO.\n\nTHE KING OF PRUSSIA AND !lIS ARMY.\u2014The King\nof Prussia has issued the following order of the day to\nthe army The glorious war against Denmark is\nended.

It appeared that on the evening in\nquestion, while the prosecutrix and her father and\nmother were sitting qu;etly at the fire in their own\nhouse, the door was opened, and the prisoners walked\nin. The prisoner Bryan was the first who caught\nhold of the prosecutrix and then the prisoner Luke\nseized her, and they brought her to the house of a\nperson named Haran, who a ied about two miles off,\nwhere she remained during the rest of the night,\nsitting by the fire, and talking to the Hara,ns and the\nprisoner Luke, and drinking punch. It appeared\nthat the prisoner Luke and the prosecutrix had been\ncourting, and at a dance a few nights previous to the\nabduction she hinted to him that her father was\nagainst the match, still, if he came and took her away,\nshe would not be very unwilling. The taking of her\nout of her father's house was accompanied with a\nshow of violence, and her clothes were dirtied, and a\npetticoat left on the road, and the two prisoners ap-\npeared to drag her away, but the moment she got\naway from the paternal eye she went very quietly to\nHara,n's house. The cross-examination of the prose -\ncurrix, who is a very good-looking girl, caused great\namusement, by her pretended unwillingness to admit\nany connivance on her part, or that she admired the\nprisoner Luke, while, on a little coaxing by the\nlearned counsel who defended, she admitted the facts\nas above stated.

All proceeded very com-\nfortably on the return journey until arriving at the toll-\nbar at Eccleston, which is situate about three-quarters\nof a mile from the scene of the accident, when one of\nthe horses became very restive and was noticed by the\n'hot-passengers on the road. On going down the hill,\nwhich is very steep, the horses appear to have overcome\n\nthe control of the driver, and dashed down it at a great\nspeed. The driver attempted to turn them into Liver-\n,pool-road, but on arriving a. the bottom of the hill the\nleft hind wheel gave way from the sudden turn, the\nspokes fell out, and the 'bus was immediately overturned.\nA fearful scene ensued; the passengers who were\ntravelling outside were dashed to the ground with gi eat\nviolence, and nearly all of them sustained injuries. The\nrapid progress of the 'bus down the hill was noticed by\npersons in houses at the foot, and as the place was well\nknown as the scene of previous accidents, fears of an\nimpending disaster were entertained by the people hear-\ning the noise. Immediately after the accident occurred\naid to the sufferers was rendered by the inhabi-\ntants of the neighbourhood. They were at once\nremoved to Mr. Whittle's (the Feathers Inn) close by,\nand medical aid was sent for without delay. The\nwounds were of a dreadful character, chiefly to the\nheads of the sufferers. One poor man, named Charles\nMorris, died shortly after the accident; he .had received\ninjuries to his head. \u2022 His skull from above the eyes to\nthe base was completely fractured. The sufferings\nof some were intense, and their groans and piercing,\ncries heartrending as the doctors set the broken limbs.\nOne poor man had both his legs broken, and one of the\nboys had his ankle laid open with a cut and his arm\nbroken. Another sufferer had his jaw smashed and his\nlip cut open, and one of the bones was forced into his\nthroat. The passengers in the inside of the 'bus\nescaped without any serious injury, excepting the fright\nand the shock. Another of the sufferers died early on\nSunday morning at his home, to which he had been re-\nmoved shortly after the doctors attended to his injuries.\nHis name was William Makin, an engineer, 26 years of\nage. The medical men who were first brought in to\nsee the men injured on Saturday night, in St. Helens,\nby the overturning of a 'bus, are most unremitting in\ntheir attention to them. Atherton is more severely\nhurt than any of the other survivors, and as his\ncase at present stands his recovery is doubtful. He is\ndreadfully crushed about the right leg, while his left\nupper arm is reduced almost to powder. He is on'y a\nlad. Mr. Proctor, son-in-law of the late proprietor, is\nalso fearfully injured; but he is rallying gradually, and\nin the event of no change setting in, is most dangerously\nhurt. On Sunday evening it was universally report- d\nthat Winstanley had died, but on Monday morning he\nwas still living, though dreadfully bruised. He has had\na compound fracture of both, legs, from which he is\nsuffering the most acute pain, and remains in a very\nweak state; but his medical attendant i,ad no appre-\nhensions. A man named Owena, whose name has not\nbefore appeared, was also injured. bur his wounds are\ncomparatively trifling, and it is believed that he will be\nconvalescent in a few days.\n","487782":", Arbour street Est, Stepney,\nAugust 2, 1864.\n\nTO TILE EDITOR or TILE BEEHIVE.\nSIR,-Being a member of the Hearts of Oak Benefit\nS ociety ray attention has been called to the subject of\nthe annual report of that society, and \"to the manner\nin which they are cooked.\" If the members will just\ngive themselves the trouble to look over the 20th\nreport they will find a great many such inst tnces as\nthat pointed out by Mr. Quibler.

The flames appear to have com-\nmenced from some unexplained Cause in the corn\nstores, and to have extended from thence, to the pro-\nvender lofts.

Before\nany of the engines arrived, the whole of the extensive\nrange of workshops were in flames, and all hopes of\nsaving them or their valuable contents were at an end.\nSome of the engines had by this time arrived, but\nbefore \u2022 they could be brought into play the fire had\nseized on the large stock of valuable wood kept in a\nyard at the rear of the burning warehouse, which speedily\nfell a prey to the flames. The efforts of the fire-\nmen were now directed to save the dwelling-house, in\nwhich they were aided by a side gateway leading down\nto the wood yard, separating the house from the ware-\nhouse. By dint of great exertions they at last suc-\nceeded, and, by cutting down some old sheds, they\nprevented a further spread of the fire.

Some of the\nwitnesses stated that the engines called Crampton's\npatent had a damaging effect on the line, and it was\nshown that the line at the spot where the accident\nhappened was frequently out of repair.\nColonel Yolland said he attended by the instructions\nof the Board of Trade. Ile would not say what had\nbeen the actual cause of the accident, but he would Say\nwhat his opinion was from the evidence he had heard.\nHe thought the evidence had been truthfully given.\nHe believed that both the first and second rails\nspoken of by Mr. Mills had been forced out by a\nheavy lurch of the engine, and probably the carriages\ngot off after they had passed the spot. He did not\nthink that one key being out would have caused the\naccident.\nThe jury, after deliberating an hour, returned the\nfollowing verdict :\u2014' We find that the deceased, Wm.\nReed, came to his death by accident; and we believe\nthat the engine left the rails in consequence of the de\u2022\nfective state of the road, which we consider mainly\nattributable to the use of the engines called 'Cramp-\nton's patent.\"'\nThe Comner said that was equivalent to a verdict of\naccidental death. He would take that opportunity of\nstating that no sort of imputation rested on the de-\nceased Witham Reed. His character had been beyond\nreproach, and he had been the best driver in the\ncompany's employ.\nMr. Martley said he might state that the Govern-\nment were making those arrangements respecting\ntheir engines which would most conduce to the safety\nof the public.\nThe inquiry then terminated.\n","387243":"HOUSE OF COMMONS.\n\nRAILWAY ACCIDENTS.\u2014On the order for going into a\nCommittee of supply, Mr. Bentinck moved a resolution\nthat, \"in consequence of the frequency and increasing\nnumber of accidents on railways, and the absence of\nany power in the executive Government to interfere for\ntheir better prevention it is desirable that power should\nbe vested by Act of Parliament in the Board of Trade,\nor in some other department of the Government, to in-\nstitute an inquiry into the causes of any accidents whith\nmay occur on railways, and examine witnesses on oath;\nand that powers should be vested in such department to\nframe and issue regulations for the conduct of the\ntraffic on railways for the safety and convenience of the\npublic.\"\u2014The motion was seconded by Mr. Jackson.\n\u2014Mr. Thompson opposed the resolution. The first\npart, he said, was unnecessary, as the Board of Trade\nnow bad power to institute inquiries, and the second\npart, which proposed to vest in the Board power to\nframe regulations, would lead to divided responsibility,\nand increase the number of accidents.\u2014Sir F. Smith\ncould not go the whole length of the resolution, which\nwould throw upon the Government the responsibility\nwhich now rested upon the railway compani( s.\u2014Mr.\nM. Gibson said he thought the first pert of the resolu-\ntion unnecessary, as the present system of inquiry was\nsuccestlul in arcertaining the cause of the accident,\nand, with regard to the other portion, a Royal Com-\nmission was appointed, which would inquire into and\nreport upon the -subject, so it would be premature for\nthe House to agree to the motion.\u2014After further ob-\nservations by Mr. Lefroy and Mr. R.

But, confining the increase to\nthe dockyards alone, the number of men was 16,000,\nand an additional 6d. a day to their wages wluld create\nan additional charge of \u00a3144,000. He pointed out the\nadvantages possessed by Royal Dockyard men over\nthose in private yards. He acknowledged that no body\nof men deserved more or did their duty better than the\ndockyard men, but they were fairly paid, and were\ncontented.\n\nTHE NAVY ESTIMATEB.\u2014The House then went into\na Committee of Supply, when Lord C. Paget moved the\nNavy Estimates. After a preliminary explanat on of\nthe form of the Estimates, he stated that the number of\nmen proposed to be votcd for the service of the year\n1865-66 was 69,750, being a decrease compared with\nthe Estimate for last year of 2,200 men. The money Esti-\nmate was 10,392,224, that of last y ?lir being \u00a310,708,651,\na decaease in the gross expenditure of \u00a3316,000. The\namount for wages, &c., was \u00a3295,006, showing a slight\nincrease over the Estimate of last yejar. Be proceeded to\nexplain the cause of this increase, the reasons why a dimi-\nnution of the number of seamen was proposed, and the\ndetails of various items in the other Estimates. He\nstated the number of armourplated ships of all classes,\ncomplete, or in such a forward state of construction\nthat they would be ready by the close of the year; and,\nhaving explained what had been done, he gave particular\ndetails of what the Government proposed to do, in the\n\nconstruction of vessels for our iron fleet. He entered\nvery fully into Vote 11, for new works, buildings, ma-\nchinery, and repairs, specifying in what manner the\nGovernment proposed to deal with the recommen-\ndations of the committee of last year. The\namount of this vote was \u00a3527,085, shoeing a real\nincrease over that of last year of \u00a330,000, the nomi-\nnal increase, including a transfer from other votes,\nbeing \u00a353,000. He explained the intentions of the\n-Government regarding the vote for the Malta Docks,\nconsequent upon the visit of the Duke of Somerset, and\nthe expenditure for a Dock at the French Creek. In\nconclusion, he took notice of reports that the navy was\nUnpopular; that there was a difficulty in manning the\nDan, and especially in obtaining continuous-service\nmen, and stated facts which negatived these reports and\nshowed that men were attached to the service. He\nread returns of the crimes and punishments in the navy\n(which he proposed to lay annually on the table), showing\ntheir diminution and the moral improvement of the service.\nOn the first vote of 69,750 men, Sir J. Paktngton said\nhe should not deal candidly with the Government if he\ndid not state that, from information he had received,\nhe was not free from apprehension as to the condition of\nour navy. After the enormous sums which had been\nplaced at the disposal of the Admiralty \u2014upwards of\n\u00a357,000,000 in five years\u2014he had been told that at this\nmoment we could not send an effective fleet to sea. He\nasked for information as to the condition of certain\nships, founding his inquiries upon information which\nimplied a want of caution and discretion on the part of\nthe Admiralty with respect to the construction of those\nvessels. He complained of the manner in which the\nAdmiralty had treated the invention of Captain\neowpc,r Coles, and asked what was the professional\nadvice under which. they now acted, lamenting that\nmen highly skilled in naval architecture should\nhave left the service of the Admiralty and should\nhave been replaced by Mr. Reed whose ships had,\nhe said, discovered imperfections, owing to want of\nexperience \u2014Sir J. Elphinstone speaking advisedly,\ndeclared the first production of? Mr. Reed to be an\nabortion. He complained of the Royal Sovereign being\nput out of commission, of other improvident acts of the\nAdmiralty, and generally of their naval policy.\u2014After\nsome further discussion the Chairman was ordered to\nreport pL.,gress.\n\nHOUSE OF LORDS\u2014MARca 7.\n\nTHE CASE OF MR. EDMUNDS.\u2014The Lord Chancellor\ncalled attention to the case of Mr. Edmunds, late read-\ning clerk of the House, and who was also clerk of the\nPatent Office and of the Commissioners of Patents, and\nstated that investigations into the accounts of that office\nshowed a deficiency of \u00a37,873, which on further in-\nquiry was shown to amount to \u00a39,100 more, although\nMr. Edmunds questioned the accuracy of this statement,\nand urged that he was only a defaulter to the first\namount. When this came to his (the Loft.' Chancellor's)\nknowledge, be submitted to the Government whether it\nwas not his duty to communicate with the House of\nLords, and consequently he had intended in the first week\nof the session to move for a committee to inquire in o the\nmater, but delayed doing so for a few days at Mr.\nEdmunds' request, and that gentleman had presented a\npetition resigning his office in the House, and asking\nfor a pension, which was referred in the usual way to a\ncommittee. He (the Lord Chancellor) might have been\nwrong in allowing this course to be taken, but the law\nofficers of the Crown were of opinion that there was no\ncase for criminal proceedings, and as the whole informa-\ntion as to the defalcations had been obtained from that\ngentleman himself he had acted as he had done. As re-\ngarded the two offices vacated by Mr. Edmunds in the\nPa'ent Office, the Prime Minister had appoint ed a relative\nof his (the Lord Chancellor) clerk of the Patent Office,\nbut the more valuable one of clerk to the commissioners\nwould not be titled up at present. He moved for a com-\nmittee to inquire into all the circumstances connected\nwith the resignat:on of Mr. E lmunds as reading c'erk\nof the llous ;.r.d the grant of a pension to him . The\n.Earl of Derby approved of the motion, and said that\nthere were tires subjects to be considered, name.y, the\nca-e of Mr. Edmunds himself, that of the comntittee\nwhich had recommended him for a pension, and the\ncourse pursued in the matter by the Lord Chan, eller.\nHe was informed that Mr. Edmunds had paid the\nmoney he received in the Patent-s ffice into a deposit\nbank, and received into, est for it, and that was all. He\nundsrstood that Mr. Ed ms it lb had been told by the Lord\nChancellor that if he is sinod no obstacle should be\nplaced in the way of his obtaining a pension.\u2014The\nLord Chancellor emphatically denied this.\u2014The Earl\nof Derby accepted the cor,tiadiction; but he thought\nthe noble and learned loi d's proper course would have\nbeen in the first instance to bring the whole matter\nbefore the House.\u2014 Lord Redeld ale, the Marquis of\nBath, and the Duke of Montrose severally complained\nthat incomplete information was brought before the\ncommittee which decided on the pension as to the de-\nfalcations in the Patent Office.\u2014After some further\ndiscussion the motion for a committee was agreed to.\n","136638":"iIEAV Y DAMAGES FOR A .RAILWA\nACCIDENT.\n\nAt the Manchester Assizes, in the Nisi Prius Court,\nbefore Mr. Baron Martin, the Rev. Robert Geo. Mime,\nan Independent minister, formerly in charge of a con-\ngregation at Tintwistle, but now residing at South-\nport, sued the London and North-Western Railway\nCompany for damages. in consequende of a railway\naccident. The case was a very peculiar one. The\naccident took place at Copley Hill, Leeds, so far back\nas Oct. 16, 1867, but it was not till November, 1868,\nthat plaintiff was permanently. disabled. in the\nmeantime he had been engaged ,as local secretary of\nthe British and Foreign Bible Society .at a salary of\n\u00a33OO per year, and travelled about the country, de-\nlivering addresses on its behalf. On November 12,\n1868, thirteen months after the accident,'he \"had, a\nparalytic attack which rendered him so complete a\nwreck that his evidence had to be taken by commis-\nsion. The question in dispute - was whether the\nparalysis resulted from the accident. The defendants\ncontended that it was too remote from the time of the\ncollision to have been caused by it, and the fact that\nthe plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel\nabout the country and deliver addresses, night after\nnight, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible\nBociety, was relied on in proof of this. On the other\nside it was maintained that from the time of the acci-\ndent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the\nfinal seizure, and that there was a continuity of\nSymptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were\ncalled on each side who directly contradicted each\nother as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The\njudge, in summing up, said the plaintiff was clearly\nentitled to damages for the sufferings he had under-\ngone since the time of the accident, but he could give\nno assistance as to the real point at issue.

The room in which\nthe inquiry was conducted, and which was situate atout\na quarter of a mile from the powder mills, was a long\napartment, furnished with numerous windows, all of\nwhich had been demolished by the explosion. The\nCoroner said that in this inquiry it would be neces-\nsary to ascertain not merely the cluse of death, but\nalso whether the machinery employed at the powder\nmills was proper for the particular manufacture,\nand, whether due precautions were taken for the\nprevention of accidents: His pra sent intention was\nmerely to open the inqulry and then adjourn it. After\nthe jury had seen the bodies and the scene of the ex-\nplosion, the following evidence was taken :\u2014Jare e 3\nWilliam Upfold, foreman of Mr. Share's gi,nnowder\nworks, said he last saw the deceased alive about 10\nminutes past 11 o'clock on Friday morn:ng, when tiny\nwere both standing at the door of the press-house\npress-house frem 7 o'clock on Friday morning, raid\ntalking to him. They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found. Mansell\nhad been employed upon the works for the past two\nyears, and Farnfield almost from his infancy.

It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally. This com-\npany paid \u00a38,351 as compsnsation for personal injui\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BATH.\u2014The Queen has been\ngraciously pleased to give orders for the following\nappointments to the Most Honounble Order of the\nBath.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep. These\npowders were to be tatters in preserves' and on Tuesday\nmorning, the nurse having prrpared one for Mrs.\nRawlin, in order to give it to her as soon as she awoke\n(she was then sleeping with the child by her side)' left\n, the room. On her rcturn, Mrs. Rawlin told her that\nthe child had been out of bed and eaten \"the goody.\"\nHe was then snoring loudly, and although she tried to\nrouse him she could not, and he shortly afterwards died.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death.\"\u2014\nWeeeli:ld Journal.\nTHE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT MONT-\nGOLFIER BALLOON. Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife. If Johnson's wife had lived there\nwould have been no hoarding up of bits of orange-peel;\nno touching all the, posts in walking along the street;\nno eating and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If\nOliver Goldsmith had been married he would never\nhave worn that memorable and ridiculous coat. When-\never you find a man whom you know little about oddly\ndressed, or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any\neccentricity of manner, you may be tolerably sure that\nhe is not a married man. For the little corners are\nrounded off, the little shoots ate pruned away, in\nmarried men. Wives generally have much more sense\nthan their husbands, especially when the husbands are\nclever men.

We\nhave now to state that Gordon has recovered from\nhis wound and is again in the field. He has been\nsuccessful as usual. On the 11th instant he attacked\nthe rebels at a place called Waisoe, where they were\nstrongly entrenched and somewhat numerous. It\nappears that these were the men who had left different\nstrongholds in rebel possession, with the intention\nof checking Gordon's movements throughout the open\nterritory. The idea was good enough, and the forces\nto whose charge the carrying out of it was en-\ntrusted, were the most desperate men in the Taeping\nranks, being the original rebels from Kiangsu and\nHupee. The Colonel began by shelling the position,\nand the effect of this was that their left flank was\nspeedily turned, upon which they began to retreat.\nGordon then gave orders to change them, which was\ndone, in a very effective manner, by the imperial troops,\nwho seemed to be rather powerful in pursuing an enemy.\nThe reports which have reached us state that the\nTaepings were rather severely cut up, the line of retreat\nbeing literally strewed with the dead. Previous to the\naction the Taepings mustered over 15,000 strong, while\nthe Imperialists were not more 10,000. These rebels\nhaving been dispersed and their return to the garrison\nprevented, the Imperialist troops 'rat made a move\nupon Chang chow-foo, which city they are now\nbesieging.

A new shaft is being made, which\nhas already reached a depth of 120 yards. At half-past\nfive o'clock, three men, Benjamin Hepworth, John\nGreenwood, and William Carter, descended for the pur-\np.ie of blasting, &c., and on their placing a blazing fusee,.\n*ma lighting it, they gave the signal to ascend, which\nthey did in the skip. When they had reached about 50,\nyards up the shaft: Hepworth looked down, and re-\nmarked:\" It's blazing,' and he had no sooner said so\nwhen a terrific explosion took place in the shaft, by\nwhich Hepworth and Greenwood were blown out of the\nskip and fell to the bottom of the shaft. Carter managed\nto keep in the skip, and was drawn to the top of the\nshaft, but he was severely burnt on the arms and face.\nThe banksman (George Spink) was thrown several yards\nfrom his post, but was not hurt. The barricading on\nthe first landing was blown completely away, several\nplanks falling into the shaft. As soon as possible after\nthe explosion two men descended the shaft in search of\ntheir unfortunate companions, whom they found dead\nand shockingly mutilated. Each of them leaves a widow\nand one child.\n\nLow ORGANISATION.\u2014The convict Bryce, who mur-\ndered the young woman at Rath\u00b0, was by the jury\nre-\ncommended to mercy on account of the lowness of his\norganisation.

There is no possibility of denying that\nBryce is a low sort o nn in organisation, as in other\nrespects both moral and mental.

The engine fell on its right side,\nand by a moit fortunate accident the driver was thremn\nin`o an adjoining meadow, where ho sustain, d only\ntemporary injuries. The stoker, who most probably was\nattending to his break, was less fortunate, and, falling\nwith the engine, was buriol under it, and his body ha i\nnot been extrlcated at six o'clock last evening. The\nguard, who was travelling in a tender immediattly\nbehind the engine, Fu ffered severe contusions, but a pro-\njecting girder saved his lire, and he escaped through\none of the windows of his van.\nThe crash was heard by the Beckenham junction\nSignalmen, and at the earliest mameet messengers were\ndespatched for assistance, all traffic up and down the\nline being stopped. The means at hand were quite in-\neffectual, but before 7 o'clock Mr. Mills, rtsident engineer\nof the line, and Mr. Manley, 1 )comotive superintendent,\nWere upon the spot. A cursory examination showed that\nhe foundations of the bridge had been serieusly affected\nby the late floods, and that the portion of the structure\ncarrying the down rails had given way either immediately\nbefore or at the moment the last goals train was in the\nact of passing over it. The engine-driver, who was on\nthe spot, and sufficiently callected to give his version\nof the disaster, stated that just h)fore the accident he\nwas going on \"as comfortably as could be,\" and that\nthe next moment be found himself thrown into she\nadjoining meadow. Mr. Mills, after surveying the state\n\u2022 of the bridge at once decided that the firs: thing to be\naccomplished was to secure in a perfectly safe c eadi, ion\nthe remaining line of metals, so that the traffic of the\nrailway might not be interrupted, the outside down rail\nalone having been destroyed by the accident. To this\nend the exertions of a large body of labourers were de-\nvoted during the whole of Send iy, and there appeared to\nbe reatonable hope that this result would be accomplished\nbefore midnight. The ordinary traffic of the railway\non Sunday was carried on by train.) on either side of\nthe bridge, the passengers alighting north or south of\nthe scene of the accident and walking over the partially\ndestroyed bridge, no through train having passed either\nabove or below the Beckenham junt'ion. The accident\nis attributed to the swol!en state of the tributary stream\nPassing beneath the bridge. In ordinary weather this\nstream merely carries off the drainage of the flit ponds\nof Mr. Hoare, the banker, and Mr. Fortescue, re\u2022idents\nin the neighbourhood, but the recent heavy snow-storm\nand rapid thaw have converted an ordinary rivulet into\na rushing river, the force of which, it is feared, has\nweakened the foundations of the bridge, and hence\nthe disaster.

Dr. Lankester, the coroner for\nCentral Middlesex, held an. inquest relative to the\ndeath of William Emery, infant son of a ham and\ntongue\n.41ea1er, of Great Portland-street, Marylebone,\nwho VMS alleged to have died through the introduc-\ntion of impure matter into the system in the opera;\ntion of vaccination. The inquest was held at the\nBrookfield Arms Tavern, Highgate Nevi-town. The\ninquiry resulted from one held a few days ago by\nMr. Bedford, the coroner for Westminster, in which\nthe same allegation was made, both children being\nvaccinated at Dr. Allen's surgery, 11, Soho-square.\nThe verdict Of the jury in the case before Mr. Bedford\nwas one of death from natural causes, Dr. Clark\nstating that the death was due to erysipelas consequent\non vaccination, not from the vaccine matter, but from\nthe punctures in the arm, the vaccine not taking effect.\nMr. Emery was present at that inquest, and, having\nlost his child from the same cause, pressed for an in-\nquiry. His child was buried at Highgate Cemetery,\nbut in conformity with the wishes of the father the\nbody was eihumed, and the present inquiry held. Mr.\nLewis, sen., attended on the part of the father of\nthe deceased; and Mr. Mirams represented Dr. Allen.\nMr. Aaron Emery, father of tho deceased, identified\nthe body as that of his son, who was vaccinated at Dr.\nAllen's establishment on the 31st of May, being then\neleven weeks old. Four wounds were made in the\nright arm, one af which appeared to be very deep. and\nbled very much. On the 7th June the child was taken\nback, the four vesicles haying taken, and two of them\nwere opened,-and some of the matter introduced into\nthe arm of another child. Two days after symptoms\nof a dang6rons character set in, principally proceeding\nfrom the largest wound, whence the matter had not\nbeen taken. The inflammation spread all over the\narm, which swelled to double its usual size. Dr. Allen\nand his assistant attended, and the swelling decreased\nin the arm, but went into the body, back, legs, and\nscrotum. From the 9th cb.y of June till its death on\nthe 4th July, the child appeared to be conscious. It\nonly dozed, and started up s'Arieking with agony. Mr.\nThomas Massey Harding, F.R.C.S., said he had been\na public vaccinator for more than twelve years. He\nhad made a post-mortem examination of the deceased,\nand found, notwithstanding its illness, that it was a\nvery fine, well-nourished child. The immediate cause\nof death was exhaustion from erysipelas produced by\nthe vaccination\u2014he thought by the cow-pox virus\nbeing introduced into the wounds. He had vaccinated\nfrom 4,000 to 5,000 children,, and he had never had a\ndeath. His brother, and Dr. Ballard, of Islington, had\nalso vaccinated some thousands, and they had only had\none death each. If erysipelas set in after vaccination\nhe might not know of it, as parents would take their\nchildren to their own doctors. An unclean lancet or\nother instrument used for making the exeoriations for\nthe reception of the lymph might produce erysipelas.\nHe had seen the child from which deoeased had been\nvaccinated, and it was perfectly healthy, as were also the\nfather and mother. The jury ultimately returned a\nverdict of Died from Erysipelas, caused by vaccination.\n\n\" Where did you get that turkey P\" said a colonel to\none of his amiable rectuits, who eatne. into camp the\noti er day with a fine bird. \" Stole it,\" was the laconic\nreply. \"Ah !\" said the colonel, triumphantly, to 's\nbystander,\" you see my boys may steal, but they won't\n\nA MEETING OF THE SAINTS AT ..119.\/kT PAULO.-1\nthought processions were over for the present, but\nlast evening there was one of some magnitude, con-\nveying a saint from one church to another, and\nspite of wet streets after heavy rain, a large num-\nber of people turned out to witness and follow the\nparticipants in the ceremony. To-day, however, it\nbeing Friday the 6th of March, was set apart for a\nspecial occasion\u2014a meeting, not a race of saints;\nand, for a wonder, the day and night have been re-\nmarkably fine, a beautiful bright moon now shining\nafter the great bustle is over and the saints gone to\nrest, though the illuminated altars in various parts\nof the city are still glittering in all their tinsel, with\nnumerous worshippers, after depositing in the plate\ntheir offerings in the shape of \"dumps,\" a slang\nphrase for copper coins. Preparatory symptoms\nhave been going on for some days at a sort of large\ncloset, or \"hole in the wall\" of the house opposite,\nbelonging to an old nobleman, whose wife departed\nthis life to-day. The folding doors had been opened\nand a large blue cloth thrown over the sanctuary\nfrom a balcony above, but still it was easy to see\nthat something unusual was in progress; and to-\nday, at about the time of the procession, the door\nopened, and the curtain was withdrawn, revealing\na very pretty altar, with a cross and small figures\nof saints at the top, the back parts and sides being\ncovered with gold and silver tinsel, and groups or\ngarlands of artificial flowers tastefully arranged,\nthe whole lighted up by an immense number of\ncandles, many of them in silver candlesticks, pro-\nvided or lent for the occasion by devotees. There\nwere about a dozen or more of these old cupboard\naltars decked out, each apparently vying for supre-\nmacy in effect. But lam forgetting the procession\nitself, which began to form at five o'clock, accom-\npanied by the usual paraphernalia\u2014a number of\nyoung girls dressed up as angels, bands of music,\nsoldiers with fixed bayonets, the President of the\nProvince, and all the dignitaries, with the high\npriest under a canopy and his attendants as before,\nwhilst in front and behind walked the multitude.\nThe meeting of the saints took place close to the\nhotel, where a halt was made, and a stout eccle-\nsiastic (the bishop's secretary, I believe), for whom\na very large pulpit had been temporarily erected at\nthe corner of four streets, addressed a very ener-\ngetic discourse to the multitude, until his voice\nbegan to get rather squeaky, nor could very much\nbe made of what he said beyond that his listeners\nwere a very bad lot, and required all the interven-\ntion of the saints before them to save them from\nperdition. The sermon ended, some music and sing-\ning took place before the altar opposite to our hotel,\nafter which the procession went on, passing all the\nstreet altars, and this part of the ceremony ended\nwhen the saints were all fairly housed. For hours,\nhowever, before the bright gaudy altars, and the\nstill brighter moon, the whole ponulation of the\nplace passed in review, making their reverence and\ndepositing their \"dumps\" or offertories.\u2014Drazil\nand the River Plate in 1868, by W. Hadfield.\nFIRST ESCAPE FROM THE TOWEIL\u2014The first of-\nfender ever lodged within its walls contrived to es-\ncape from his guards to let himself down from a\nwindow, and to slip through the postern to his boat.\nThis bold offender was that Ralph of Durham, called\nthe Firebrand and the Lion, who for many years\nhad been the treasurer and justiciar to the Norman\nkings. On the death of Rufus he was seized by the\nCommons until the new king's pleasure should be\nknown about him \u2022 and Henry the Scholar, who had\ngood deeds rather'than good rights to befriend him\nin his contest with Robert for the crown, sent the\nunpopular prelate to the tower. Henry was not in-\nclined to harshness; and Ralph, though lodged in\nthe keep which he had helped to build, was treated\nlike a guest. He lived in the upper rooms, on the\ntier now known as the banqueting-floor ; his rooms\nhaving plenty of space and light, a good fireplace,\na private closet, and free access to St. John's chapel.\nWilliam de Mandeville, Constable of the Tower, was\nappointed his keeper, and two shillings a day were\npaid from the King's exchequer for his diet. He\nwas suffered to have his own servants and chaplains\nin his rooms, and to send out for such wines and\n'meats as his stomach craved and his purse could buy.\nOne of the richest men in England, he could buy\na good deal; one of the cleverest men in England, he\ncould scheme a long way. But before resorting to his\nmoney and his wits in self-defence, Ralph tried how\nfar he could reckon on the virtues of the pastoral\nstaff. A bishop was not only a baron of the realm,\nsiing as\nthis ju\ngdrgonen;\nbut a prince of the universal Church. No doubt he\nhad exercised lay functions, acting as a financier,\nwhom the se-ular laws were held to have no binding\nforce.

The stout Norman 'knights who kept guard\nin his chamber were jolly fellows, fond of good cheer\nand lusty at a song. On this weakness he began to\nplay. Sending for good wine, and giving orders to\nhis cook, he invited to his table a belt of boisterous\nknights. When the folks looked up at the keep, in\nwhich their enemy was caged, they saw lights in\nthe windows rather late, and haply went to bed, in\nthe pious hope that their bad bishop was going\nquickly to his proper doom. At length his scheme was\nripe. Asking the knights to supper he sent out for\njars of wine; a potent liquor which, in due time,\nlaid those warriors asleep on bench and floor. The\ntime was winter (the date February, 1101), the night\ncame down quickly on the Tower. When the guards\nwere all drunk, the sober bishop rose from his table,\ndrew a long coil of rope from one of the jars, passed\ninto the South room, tied his cord to the window'\nshaft, and taking his crozier with him, let himself\nrpautth et\nrr\nosshtoyr ts,e\nravnado\nths o\nwhofell\ndown.

The officer,\n3.l`Queen, said Clifford was a deserter from H.M.S.\nCornwallis at Plymouth, and was comraitLed from\nWandsworth that afternoon, and Groves, anoiher\npoliceman, was instructed to take him to Woolwich.\nGroves was in unform. As Clifford was violent, wit-\nness, who was in private clothes, was instructed to\naccompany and assist Groves. As they were convey-\ning the deserter from Northumberland House the pri-\nsoner rushed up and seized witness by the throat, ex-\nclaiming, \"What are you going to do with this\nman ?\" The prisoner, from the commencement of the\ncase, exhibited great excitement, agitation, and con-\nfusion, and Sir Thomas Henry was obliged to check\nhim. The witness went on to say that the prisoner\nattempted to rescue the deserter, and -called upon the\nby-standers to assist, addressing them as \"brothers,\"\nand demanding whether they would allow a fellow-\ncreature, innocent of any crime, to be dragged away\nto a dungeon? Clifford, encouraged by this attempt\nto rescue him, tried desperately to get away, and\nseverely wounded Grove's face with his handcuffs.\nUltimately Carleton was given in custody. . The\nofficer Groves, and another witness, an accidental\npasser-by, corroborated. The prisoner said he had\nonly done his duty, as England expected of every\nman, and as Lord Nelson had done. It would be his\nduty to interfere if a man was about to be shot in the\nstreet. It was well known that in the present critical\nstate of politics in England the police were in the\nconstant habit of arresting persons, and instead of\ndetaining them, or preferring any charge against\nthem, the officers privately assassinated them. Sir\nThomas Henry\u2014How could you know that he was\nnot in lawful custody under a Warrant? The pri-\nsoner\u2014Let me see the warrant. Sir Thomas Henry\u2014\nI have objection. The prisoner, after reading the\nwarrant, declared, in a patronising manner, that it\nWas \"quite correct.\" Sir Thomas Henry\u2014Then you\nsee you were in the wrong? The prisoner\u2014Oh, dear,\nno. Sir Thomas Henry said he must remand him.\nPrisoner\u2014Remand me! lam a man now. Sir\nThomas Henry\u2014l shall have you put back till the\n26th inst. The prisoner\u2014Oh! detain me. I thought\nYOU were joking. Sir Thomas Henry\u2014Remand is the\nusual term. After the prisoner's removal, Sir Thomas\nHenry observed that it would have been better not to\nhave brought a desperate man, handcuffed, through\nthe streets in open day from Victoria-to Charing-cross.\n\nWOUNDING WITH INTENT TO MURDER.\nThomas Connel, a respectable-looking man, was\nindicted at the Central Criminal Court AI the 16th\ninst.' for feloniously wounding Mary Ann Beckett,\nWith intent to murder her. In a second count it was\nalleged that he intended to do her grievous bodily\nharm. Mr. Brindley prosecuted. The prisoner had\nbeen living with the prosecutrix, a widow, and on the\nnight of the 4th of May they went to bed together.\nDuring the night the prisoner got up and cut her throat\nwith a knife' inflicting a very dangerous wound. She\nthen ran out, and was taken to the hospital, were she\nreceived immediate medical attention, and she had\nsince recovered from the injuries that had been inflicted\nUpon her. The prisoner also cut his own throat, but\nhad since recovered. It appeared that there had been\na quarrel between them, in consequence of the prisoner\nhaving found the prosecutrix in bed with another man\non the previous Friday. The prisoner's father and\nbrother were called, and stated that he had been in the\narmy ten years, and received his discharge in 1868.\nSince then he had occasionally been employed as a\nprinter. His mother and aunt had been insane, and\nhis own mind had become affected since his return\nfrom India with his regiment, where he had suffered\nfrom sunstroke. Mr. Jonas, the governor of Newo-ate,\nstated that he had had the prisoner under his charge\nfor four or five weeks, and had observed nothing in\nhis conduct that would lead him to suppose him of un-\nsound mind. The prisoner addressing the jury, said\nhe was sitting up cutting his tobacco, when the prose-\ncutrix kept pulling his shirt, and he, forgetting he had\na knife in his hand, made a \" hit \"at her. If he had\nhad any murderous intent he could have prevented her\nleaving the room. The jury found the prisoner guilty\non the second count, and recommended him to\nmercy. The learned judge commented upon the enor-\nmity of the crime he had committed and the serious\nconsequences that might have followed, and sentenced\nhim to five years' Penal servitude.\n","323505":"HOUSE OF LORDS.-MARCH 13.\n\nBILLS.\u2014Lord Clarendon introduced the Public Schools\nBill, which was read a first time, and the second resding\nfixed for the 27th of March.\u2014The British Caffraria\nBill, and the Election Petitions Act (1848) Amendment\nBill were both read a second time.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS.\n\nin the States, that circumstance affordei a strong\ntemptation to enter into a war with England It was\nper'ectly well known that there was no power whatever\nin the United Kingdom to defend successfully Canada\nagainst the United States. Would Canada attack the\nStates? Certainly not. Would the States attack\nCanada? He believed clearly not, with a view to its\nforcible anrexation to the Union. No person in Eng-\nland was for going to war with the United States.\nWas the United States for war with this country? Tne\nrelations between the two countries had for some time\nbeen growing more and more amicable. Then if Canada\nwas not for war, nor England, nor the United States,\nt'hence was it to come ? He suggested that there\nmight be some anxiety in this country, some prick\nof conscience about the manner in which the\nAmerican Government had been treated, and be re-\nferred to various transactions calculated, in his opinion,\nto create irritation and exasperation in the United\nStates. What, he asked, would the people of this\ncountry hare said if they bad suffered as the people of\nAmerica had suffered from the Alabama? It might be\nsaid that these things would tend to provoke a desire\nfor vengeance and increase the chances of war. This\nwas, he said, to the last degree improbable. There\nwere millions of men in Lancashire who had had no\nkind of sympathy with the views he condemned, and\nthere were securities for peace in America itself. He\nbelieved there was a war party in the United States\u2014\nthe Irish party, but that was the only war party, and\nthe real power in the States was with another claqs.\nThe root of all these unfortunate circumstances was, he\nsaid, a feeling of jealousy entertained in this country\ntowards the American nation\u2014a feeling which would\nnot overthrow the decrees of nature.\u2014Lord Palmerston\ndenied that there existed in this country a jealousy of\nAmerica. No doubt, during the contest now going on\nin that country, there was a feeling of irritation in both\nNorth and South that this country, a third party, had\nnot espoused their cause; but ho believed that among\nthe great bulk of the people of the United States there\nwas a good feeling towards this country, and that when\nthe present contest was over that natural feeling would\nprevail over any temporary irritation. But this was\nno reason why we should not place our colonies in\nAmerica in a state of defence. He could not agree\nwith Mr. Lowe, and it was not the intention of the\nGovernment to follow his advice. He added, in con-\nclusion, that the relations of the two Government were\nperfectly friendly.\u2014The debate upon this subject here\nterminated.\n\nHOUSE OF LORDS.\u2014MARcii 14.\n\nBILLS.\u2014The Bankruptcy and Insolvency (Ireland)\nAct Amendment Bill w is referred to a Select Committee;\nand the British Caffi aria Pill and the Election Petitions\nAct Amendment Bill passed through Committee.\nTHE CASE OF MARY RYAN.\u2014Lord Westmeath drew\nattention to the papers presented in the case of Mary\nRyan.

He th\u2022ught\nthe young woman had been cruelly used, and, though\nit had been asserted she was mad, it had not been atis-\nfactorily proved. He complained also that some oi the\ndocuments necessary to the proper understanding of\nthe case had been kept back. He denounced the whole\nproceeding, and contended that the Home Secretary\nought not to be the only jud;e whether the law ought\nto be put in force with regard to it.\u2014Lord Russell said\nit was not unusual for nuns afflic'ed with insanity to\nbe removed to establishments abroad. But the practice,\nthough usual, was really illegal. In this ca=e, however,\nevery facility had been given to the investigation\ndirected by the Government, and it had been fully\nascertained that the young woman was insane. She was\nwell taken care of, and, as the parties who had removed\nher did not appear to have been actuated by improper\nmotives, it had not been thought expedient to prosecute\nthem.\u2014Lord Malmesbury was convinced by a perusal\nof the papers that Mary Ryan was mad, and that the\nGovernment had done all it could to invest.gate the\nease. The parties had no doubt acted in iAnDrance of\nthe law of the country, but in some instances, as\n.when\nmagistrates sent persons to lunatic asylumns without\n-sufficient inquiry, such ignorance deserved a public\nreproof from the Home Secretary. A private rebuke\nwas useless. In this respect he thought the case had\nbeen treated too lightly.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS.\n\nTzrz BUDGET.--In reply to Mr. J.

Sir George Grey,\nreplying to a question put by Mr. Scully, relative to the\nremoval of the Irish nun, Mary Ryan, to a madhouse\nin Belgium, said it was illegal by force to remove a\nlunatic from the country, and thereby deprive him or\nher of the protection of our laws. Mary Ryan having\nbeen illegally removed, her Majesty's Government were\nprepared to request, the Belgian Government, who\nwere quite ready to accede to the request. to send her\nback, provided her eondition were such as to justify her\nremoval; but it appeared that in her present state it\nWould be highly injudicious to do so._ _ _\n\nTHE CASE OF PRINCE AZP:EM JAIL-Sir F. Ksll y\nmoved for a select committee to inquire into the claim\nof Prince Azeem Jab to the title and dignity of Nawab\nof the Carnatic, and the claims of his Highness, under\na treaty entered into in 1801 between the East India\nCompany and Prince Azeem-ul-Dowl th. Looking at\nthe nature of the questions involved in this case, he\nonly asked, he said, that, in order that there should be\na full and fair inquiry into all the circumstances, it\nshould be referred to a select committee, so that the\nHouse and the Government might be able to do justice to\nthis unfortunate Prince. The real question, which arose\nout of a certain alleged treasonable correspondence dis-\ncovered in 1799, WAS whether it was of such a character as\nte justify the East India Company in at once deposing the\nNawab in 1855. Sir Fitzroy entered into a long and minute\nhistory of transactions connected with the Carnatic,\ncommencing more than a century ago, up to the treaty\nof 1801, with the then Nawab Azeem-ul-Dowlah.\nSupposing, he said, that the Company would have been\njustified in deposing the Newel) Wallaj th, upon_ the\ndiscovery of the correspondence, or Omdut Omrah,\nhis successor, the question wag --Whether, under the\ntreaty of 1801, the Navratec-Amenvul-Dowlah was re-\ncognised as heredity\u2014successor to a transmis ible title\nanelsara7l.teYesCi\u2022 only as possessor of the rank for his life.\nThis was a question\u2014the legal construction of the treaty\n\u2014which that House' he observed, was not a proper\ntribunal to decide. He cited documents to show tint\nthe treaty was understood to convey a recognition of the\nhereditary dignity in the Nawab, a construction which\nseemed to be con firmed by the succession to the Musnud of\nthe eldest son of A zem-ul-Dowlah, on the death of the\nlatter in 1819.\u2014The motion was seconded by Mr.\nSmollett in a long speech, in which he denounced the\n\"Carnatic transaction\" as an act of grave injustice,\nreflecting discredit upon the authors.\u2014Sir E. Dering\ndefended Lord Harris against charges made by Mr.\nSmollett, complaining, with some warmth, of the\nunmeasured terms in which he had impugned the con-\nduct of that nobleman when Governor of Madras with\nreference to the treaty of 1801; and he appealed to\nevidence which showed that that treaty was considered\nto confer no right of hereditary succession, but was a\npurely personal engagement. He thought Sir F.\nKelly bad not made out any substantial ground\nfor the appointment of a committee. After a\nfew observations by Mr. Vansittart and Mr. Neate,\nthe Solicitor- General observed that the maintenance\nin India of a number of nomin 11 Sovereigns\nwas an admitted evil, and their abolition was beneficial\nto the people of India, and did harm or injury to no\nhuman being. Then were we, notwithstanding, bound\nto perpetrate the evil? It was said that we were\nbound by the treaty of 1801. He contended that the\nterms of the treaty bore no such construction; that it\nwas not the intention of the treaty; on the contrary,\nthat it was framed expressly for the purpose of excluding\nthe possibility of such an interpretation. He proceeded\nto show that there had been a clear case of treachery on\nthe part of the Nawabs of the Carnatic; that a cone-\nsuondence of a treisonable character between\nWallajah and Omdut-ul Omrah and Tippoo Sultan\nhad been discovered which gave us the right\nand the power to depose the Nawab. He ex-\nplained the grounds of the treaty of 1801, which\nwas a personal treaty, under which it was intended\nthat the then Nawab, Azeem-ul-Dowlah, should hold\n1 the title by permission of the East India Company, ant\nI not by hereditary right, which could be claimed neither\nby the letter or spirit of the treaty, nor by the\nintention of its framers. He insisted that the House\n' could decide upon the case, and that nothing but evil\ncould result from the appointment of a committee.\u2014\nMr. Ilenne,sy observed that only inquiry was asked\nfor, and he was surprised that the Government\nresisted it.\u2014Mr. Dunlop thought it was a case for\ninquiry.\u2014Mr. H. Seymour opposed the motion. He\n, thought that neither on legal grounds nor upon the\nground of expo lieney could the motion for an inquiry\nIby a commit tee be maint tined. At the same time, the\nEsst India-offi-e should, in his opinion, take the case of\n' this unfortunate family into consideration.\u2014After a few\nwords by Mr. Ingham, Sir C. Wood justified the policy\nand justice of the course which had been taken in the\ncase of the Carnatic family upon public as well as\nspecial grounds, and insisted that it bad been attended\nwith no breach of faith. He gave a short hiatory of\nthe transactions which resulted in the treaty of\n1801, and an explanation of its object, which was,\nafter the Carnatic had been forfeitsd by the family,\nto give to the then Nawab Azeem-ul-Dowlah the\n' title for life only, the words \" him and his heirs,\" and\nI all terms implying Perpetuity, being intentionally\nomitted. He cited the opinions of Indian statesmen\nand other authorities adverse to any claim of heriditary\nright in his descendants.\u2014The discussion was continued\n! by Colonel Dickson and Colonel Sykes.\u2014Upon a\ndivision the motion was negatived by 53 to 38.\nI EDUCATION.\u2014The &lea Committee On Education\nwas nominated.\n\nOUR RELATIONS WITH AMERICA.\u2014On the order for I\ngoing into a Committee of Supply, Mr. S. Fitzgerald\ncalled attention to the report of Colonel Jervois with\nreference to the defences of Canada, and asked for in-\nformation with reference thereto. After clearing himself\nfrom false imputations in taking this course, and\ndisclaiming any intention to attribute to the Federal\nGovernment or to the people generally a spirit of\nhostility towards this country, he suggested certain\npossible contingencies which might lead to hostilities\nbetween this country and the United States, and against\n'which we should not, he said, shut our eyes, nor dis-\nregard a certain proposal made during the recent\nconference between the Confederate agents and the\nFederal authorities. Under these circumstances, it was\nof importance to look to the defence of Canada, upon\nwhich in the event of war the first blow would fall,\nand, as no one would advise that the colony should\nbe left to defend itself in a quarrel in which it would\nbe involved solely on account of its connection with\nthis country, he proceeded to consider what were its\nmeans of defence and what it should be our duty to\ncontribute towards its defences, the state of which he\ndescribed. He referred to the proposals containi-\nthe report of Colonel Jervois, and askred2v,h_all;teps had\nbeen taken by the Goverup2ate fue carry out these pro-\nposals, and to aueTeceilt the defensive resoarces of the\nl coony\n- compared the activity of the Americans in\ntortifYing all their vulnerable points with the apathy\nmanifested by us in altogether neglecting the defences\nof our most vulnerable point, Canada. He urged\nthis as a matter, he said, of pressing and p iramount\nnecessity, and that unless we set to work vigilantly,\nand came to an immediate understanding with ,\nCanada as to the proportion this country should. '\nbear of the cost of its means of defence, the conse-\nquences would be fatal.\u2014Mr. W. Forster believed that\nthe fears of hostilities on the part of the United States '\nwere unreasonable and utterly groundless, and he drew\nfrom some of the facts referred to by Mr. Fitzgerald\nconclusions consistent with pacific and friendly feelings\non the part of that Government towards this country.\nWhy, then be asked, should there be this extraordinary\nsuspicion Of America? It arose, he said, from the\nefforts of two classes,\u2014one consisting of Confederate\nagents and sympathisers; the other of disappointed\nprophets. Having insisted upon the groundlessness of\nthe fears of war with America, he protested against ;\nrushing into an enormous expense for the defence of\nCanada.\u2014Mr. Cardwell said he could assure the House,\nwithout reserve' that our relations with the United\nStates continued to be perfectly friendly. But, what-\never might be the prospect of our future relations with\ntheir Government, it was not upon the forbearance of\nother countries that reliance was placed, but upon our\nown inherent strength. Those who went to war with\nCanada went to war with England. The Government\nwere prepared to do their part in the defence of Canada,\nbut it was their opinion, and they had strongly expressed\nit, that the main defence of the colony should be found in\nthe spirit and energy of the people, and he had the satis-\nfaction of stating that efforts, which might have been made\nearlier, were now making in the colcry with the best pos-\nBible spirit.\u2014Mr. Disraeli, after paying a tribute to the ,\nmanner in which the Federal Government had conducted\ntheir relations with this country under circumstances\nof great difficulty, avowed his opinion that we were in\nno immediate danger of com;ng into collision with that\nGovernment, because he believed that the people of the\nUnited States were a sagacious people, and were not\nlikely to engage in another struggle with a foreign\n'Power. There were other reasons (which he explained)\nthat induced him to adopt this opinion. There were\nelements in operation which would hereafter work an\nalteration in the United States, and our North American\ncolonies would become a powerful federation. He\nurged that our relations with those dependencies\ndemanded serious consideration. To abandon them\nwould be a disastrous and fatal step. Then, what\nshould be our course? To place them in a state of\nproper defence. He referred to the inconsistent con-\nduct of the Government in this matter. .11e did not,\nhe said, blame them fcr being inconsistent, but he la-\nmented the consequence of discordant opinions\u2014that\nthe colonies had not been defended.\u2014Mr. Lowe said he\nShould confine himself to the simple question, what this\ncountry ought to do and was bound to do. Suppose we\nwere actually at war with the United States, Colonel\nJervois stated that our troops would be obliged to flee\nto their ships, and therefore we should make fortifica-\ntions. But if we had fortifications the troops would be\ndriven into them. There was no conceivable disparity\nof numbers which the Araertans might not bring to\noverwhelm them. No fortifications could be held\nagainst this force aided by modern\nartillery, so that if\nour troops were driven into the t\u2022 or c-ta,oris it would\nbe impossible for them to escape. The question was,\nwhat should be done if Canada was the battle-\nground in case of war. The most effectual\ncourse in such an event would be to ewe_\nceptrate a force upon some other point. His conclusion,\ntherefore, was that it would be unwise to retain any\nforce worth speaking of in Canada. Then, if we should\nnot keep troops there in time of war, why in time of\npeace? We had better let Canada know the truth, and.\nnot buoy her up with false expectations, while we pro-\nvoked America by a standing menace. The wisest course\nwould be at once to withdraw our troops.\u2014After obser-\nvations by Sir J. Fergusson, Mr. J. White, Mr. C.\nFortescuo, Sir F. Smith, Mr. Watkin, Sir M. Farquhar,\nLord Elcho, Mr. Ayrton, and Lord R. Cecil, Mr. Bright\nsaid the question was at once important anti delicate.\nThe difficulty was that we had an extensive colony lying\nadjacent to the -United States, and, if there be a war party\n\nHOUSE OF COMMONS.\u2014IIIAncu 15.\nPUBLICHOCSE ACT AMENDMENT Cox said\nhe would postpone the second reading of this bill till\n]Star ch 30.\nitlEs IN CRIMINAL CASES BILL.\u2014Sir C.

J. Carttar, coroner for West Kent, resumed\nand concluded an inquiry at the Pier Tavern, Elite, on\nMarch 13, relative to the melam_holy accident which\noccurred by the upsetting of a boat in the Thames on\nthe 28th February, in consequence of which ten cadets,\nbelonging to the training ship Worcester, lost their\nlives. Mr. Henry Green, chairman; Mr. Chamberlain,\ndeputy chairman; Mr. Bullivant, seretary ; and other\ngentlemen connected with the seciety, attended to\nwatch the proceedings, and the inquest room was\ncrowded.\nMr. Tipple, surgeon, of Erith, said that he saw the\nbody of the deceased Cadet Harrison immediately\nafter it was landed. Death was caused by drowning.\nBenjamin Joseph Beckwith, aged 17, cadet on board\nthe Worcester training ship, explained how the boat\ngot capsized. The incidents are already well known.\nWitness jumped into the river as the boat was turning\nover, and was afterwards picked up. He could swim,\nand when he rose on the top of the water he saw some\nof the other lads swimming, and heard one cry out that\nhe had got the cramp. The boys were not looking\nover the side of the boat, and there was no larking\ngoing on. Witness had known the boat eight or nine\nmonths, and considered that she was an excellent\nboat in every respect. When the boat was wearing\nCashman told one of the lads to loosen the foresail,\nand he let it go. This had nothing to with the\naccident, and would rather tend to have prevented it.\nBy the jury: Johnson, the cadet who was lost whilst\ntrying to save others, could swim. All the cadets were\ntrained to The art of swimming.\nJames Awdry, another cadet, aged 16, gave corrobo-\nrative evidence, and in reply to the coroner said he\ncould not tell why the boat capsized. At the time of\nthe accident the head of the boat was towards the north\nshore. Witness could swim, and was swimming when\nhe was picked up. After she capsized the boat partly\nrighted herself again, and a great many of the cadets\nwere clinging to her, when she turned over again\ncompletely.\nJames Palmer, a cadet, gave similar evidence.\nCaptain George Whitby, commander of the Worces-\nter, was then examined, and said he saw the three\nboats leave the vessel. The boat which capsized was\nthe largest. It was purchased by the society in Sep-\ntember last from the Boat Building Company at East\nGreenwich. She was 29 feet long, 6 feet 7 inches in\nthe beam, and appeared to be an excellent boat in\nevery respect. Cashman, the boatswain, was in charge\nof this boat. Cashman joined the ship in August last.\nHe had previouily had many years' experience, and\nwitness had always considered him to be a most efficient\nas he was a most trustworthy man. He first received\ninformation of the a,ccident from a screw steamer,\nwhich hailed him when going down the river.\nBy the Coroner: He never sent ballast in the boat ;\nhe did not approve of that plan\u2014in fact, considered it\ndangerous, and that many lives had been lost by\nplacing ballast in bolts. The majority of the cadets on\nboard the Worcester could swim. He inspected the\nsails of the boat when they were being made. He did\nnot think that the boat was over-canvassed. The sails\nwere made of very light canvas.\nJames Sims, a waterman, of Greenwich, who was\nnear the spot where the accident took place, in his\nboat, said: Immediately before she capiz, d he saw\nthat the boat was on the starboard tack, with her head\nright down. He saved three persons, and got the\ndeceased Cadet Harrison into his boat, but he appeared\nthen to be lifeless. He saved Cashman, who called\nout, \"Never mind me; I am all right; save the\nothers.\" He did not think that the boat could have\nturned quite keel upwards, as the sails would not have\nallowed it. The wind was fresh. Witness never\ncarried ballast in his boat, and did not approve of that\nplan.\nThe men who had charge of the two other boats were\nexamined, but their testimony was unimportant.\nJohn Cashman, the boatswain in charge of the cap-\nsized boat (having been duly cautioned by the coroner),\nsaid he wished to state all that he knew respecting the\naccident. He had been nineteen years is. her Majesty's\nservice before he joined the 'Worcester. Immediately\npreceding this engagement he was a gunner on board\nthe President training-ship for the Naval Reserve.\nAfter repeating the evidence given as to the arrival of\nthe boat at Crossness Point, the witness said: When\none of the cadets lost his cap, be told a lad named\nHolmes to ea.e the foresheet, and Holmes let go the\nsheet altogether. That rather helped witness than\notherwise in the movement he intended to make in\norder to get the cap. Up to the time of tbo accident\nthe boat had behaved well, and had not shipped more '\nthan a quart of water. Before the accident he was on\nthe port tack, standing over to the opposite shore. He\nwore the boat about till she came round on the starboard\ntack, when the wind took her on the starboard quarter,\nand she went down instantly. He could not account\nfor the boat going over in any way.\nBy the Jury: She was keel uppermost before he told\nthe cadets to cling to her; finding there was no other\nchance he called out to the cadets in the water, \"Strike\nout for the boat,\" and he believed they all did so.\nThere were not too many lads in the boat; hstd there\nbeen a few more the accident might not have happened,\nas thep would have acted as ballast. He did not approve\nof taking ballast in the boat. Now that the accident\nbn taken place, he thought it would be better that the\nkeel of the boat should be a little deepened. He had\nalways considered her a very safe boat.\nThe jury, without consultation, returned a verdict of\n\"Accidental death.\"\n","461079":"LATEST INTELL IGEN CE\n\nis only a medium for the collection of money to\ndefray\/the outlay \u2022 of \"'striking,\" whereas the\nstrike branch is a very small department of the\nbusiness, and, a member may become a great\nloser of money by expulsion from or resignation\nof the lunds and membership of his society.\nThe operatives declined this dictation.

Now these facts prove that our\nwealth manufacturing has, in its progress, very\nimequally. affected 'various classes. It has in-\ncreaed life and riches to a few, and mortality\nand relative evils fo the many; and this is the\ncause and ground of the dissatisfaction, of which\nstrikes and Trades' Unions are the external and\nvisible 'sigh'.

Dr. Lankester, the coroner for\nCentral Middlesex, held an. inquest relative to the\ndeath of William Emery, infant son of a ham and\ntongue\n.41ea1er, of Great Portland-street, Marylebone,\nwho VMS alleged to have died through the introduc-\ntion of impure matter into the system in the opera;\ntion of vaccination. The inquest was held at the\nBrookfield Arms Tavern, Highgate Nevi-town. The\ninquiry resulted from one held a few days ago by\nMr. Bedford, the coroner for Westminster, in which\nthe same allegation was made, both children being\nvaccinated at Dr. Allen's surgery, 11, Soho-square.\nThe verdict Of the jury in the case before Mr. Bedford\nwas one of death from natural causes, Dr. Clark\nstating that the death was due to erysipelas consequent\non vaccination, not from the vaccine matter, but from\nthe punctures in the arm, the vaccine not taking effect.\nMr. Emery was present at that inquest, and, having\nlost his child from the same cause, pressed for an in-\nquiry. His child was buried at Highgate Cemetery,\nbut in conformity with the wishes of the father the\nbody was eihumed, and the present inquiry held. Mr.\nLewis, sen., attended on the part of the father of\nthe deceased; and Mr. Mirams represented Dr. Allen.\nMr. Aaron Emery, father of tho deceased, identified\nthe body as that of his son, who was vaccinated at Dr.\nAllen's establishment on the 31st of May, being then\neleven weeks old. Four wounds were made in the\nright arm, one af which appeared to be very deep. and\nbled very much. On the 7th June the child was taken\nback, the four vesicles haying taken, and two of them\nwere opened,-and some of the matter introduced into\nthe arm of another child. Two days after symptoms\nof a dang6rons character set in, principally proceeding\nfrom the largest wound, whence the matter had not\nbeen taken. The inflammation spread all over the\narm, which swelled to double its usual size. Dr. Allen\nand his assistant attended, and the swelling decreased\nin the arm, but went into the body, back, legs, and\nscrotum. From the 9th cb.y of June till its death on\nthe 4th July, the child appeared to be conscious. It\nonly dozed, and started up s'Arieking with agony. Mr.\nThomas Massey Harding, F.R.C.S., said he had been\na public vaccinator for more than twelve years. He\nhad made a post-mortem examination of the deceased,\nand found, notwithstanding its illness, that it was a\nvery fine, well-nourished child. The immediate cause\nof death was exhaustion from erysipelas produced by\nthe vaccination\u2014he thought by the cow-pox virus\nbeing introduced into the wounds. He had vaccinated\nfrom 4,000 to 5,000 children,, and he had never had a\ndeath. His brother, and Dr. Ballard, of Islington, had\nalso vaccinated some thousands, and they had only had\none death each. If erysipelas set in after vaccination\nhe might not know of it, as parents would take their\nchildren to their own doctors. An unclean lancet or\nother instrument used for making the exeoriations for\nthe reception of the lymph might produce erysipelas.\nHe had seen the child from which deoeased had been\nvaccinated, and it was perfectly healthy, as were also the\nfather and mother. The jury ultimately returned a\nverdict of Died from Erysipelas, caused by vaccination.\n\n\" Where did you get that turkey P\" said a colonel to\none of his amiable rectuits, who eatne. into camp the\noti er day with a fine bird. \" Stole it,\" was the laconic\nreply. \"Ah !\" said the colonel, triumphantly, to 's\nbystander,\" you see my boys may steal, but they won't\n\nA MEETING OF THE SAINTS AT ..119.\/kT PAULO.-1\nthought processions were over for the present, but\nlast evening there was one of some magnitude, con-\nveying a saint from one church to another, and\nspite of wet streets after heavy rain, a large num-\nber of people turned out to witness and follow the\nparticipants in the ceremony. To-day, however, it\nbeing Friday the 6th of March, was set apart for a\nspecial occasion\u2014a meeting, not a race of saints;\nand, for a wonder, the day and night have been re-\nmarkably fine, a beautiful bright moon now shining\nafter the great bustle is over and the saints gone to\nrest, though the illuminated altars in various parts\nof the city are still glittering in all their tinsel, with\nnumerous worshippers, after depositing in the plate\ntheir offerings in the shape of \"dumps,\" a slang\nphrase for copper coins. Preparatory symptoms\nhave been going on for some days at a sort of large\ncloset, or \"hole in the wall\" of the house opposite,\nbelonging to an old nobleman, whose wife departed\nthis life to-day. The folding doors had been opened\nand a large blue cloth thrown over the sanctuary\nfrom a balcony above, but still it was easy to see\nthat something unusual was in progress; and to-\nday, at about the time of the procession, the door\nopened, and the curtain was withdrawn, revealing\na very pretty altar, with a cross and small figures\nof saints at the top, the back parts and sides being\ncovered with gold and silver tinsel, and groups or\ngarlands of artificial flowers tastefully arranged,\nthe whole lighted up by an immense number of\ncandles, many of them in silver candlesticks, pro-\nvided or lent for the occasion by devotees. There\nwere about a dozen or more of these old cupboard\naltars decked out, each apparently vying for supre-\nmacy in effect. But lam forgetting the procession\nitself, which began to form at five o'clock, accom-\npanied by the usual paraphernalia\u2014a number of\nyoung girls dressed up as angels, bands of music,\nsoldiers with fixed bayonets, the President of the\nProvince, and all the dignitaries, with the high\npriest under a canopy and his attendants as before,\nwhilst in front and behind walked the multitude.\nThe meeting of the saints took place close to the\nhotel, where a halt was made, and a stout eccle-\nsiastic (the bishop's secretary, I believe), for whom\na very large pulpit had been temporarily erected at\nthe corner of four streets, addressed a very ener-\ngetic discourse to the multitude, until his voice\nbegan to get rather squeaky, nor could very much\nbe made of what he said beyond that his listeners\nwere a very bad lot, and required all the interven-\ntion of the saints before them to save them from\nperdition. The sermon ended, some music and sing-\ning took place before the altar opposite to our hotel,\nafter which the procession went on, passing all the\nstreet altars, and this part of the ceremony ended\nwhen the saints were all fairly housed. For hours,\nhowever, before the bright gaudy altars, and the\nstill brighter moon, the whole ponulation of the\nplace passed in review, making their reverence and\ndepositing their \"dumps\" or offertories.\u2014Drazil\nand the River Plate in 1868, by W. Hadfield.\nFIRST ESCAPE FROM THE TOWEIL\u2014The first of-\nfender ever lodged within its walls contrived to es-\ncape from his guards to let himself down from a\nwindow, and to slip through the postern to his boat.\nThis bold offender was that Ralph of Durham, called\nthe Firebrand and the Lion, who for many years\nhad been the treasurer and justiciar to the Norman\nkings. On the death of Rufus he was seized by the\nCommons until the new king's pleasure should be\nknown about him \u2022 and Henry the Scholar, who had\ngood deeds rather'than good rights to befriend him\nin his contest with Robert for the crown, sent the\nunpopular prelate to the tower. Henry was not in-\nclined to harshness; and Ralph, though lodged in\nthe keep which he had helped to build, was treated\nlike a guest. He lived in the upper rooms, on the\ntier now known as the banqueting-floor ; his rooms\nhaving plenty of space and light, a good fireplace,\na private closet, and free access to St. John's chapel.\nWilliam de Mandeville, Constable of the Tower, was\nappointed his keeper, and two shillings a day were\npaid from the King's exchequer for his diet. He\nwas suffered to have his own servants and chaplains\nin his rooms, and to send out for such wines and\n'meats as his stomach craved and his purse could buy.\nOne of the richest men in England, he could buy\na good deal; one of the cleverest men in England, he\ncould scheme a long way. But before resorting to his\nmoney and his wits in self-defence, Ralph tried how\nfar he could reckon on the virtues of the pastoral\nstaff. A bishop was not only a baron of the realm,\nsiing as\nthis ju\ngdrgonen;\nbut a prince of the universal Church. No doubt he\nhad exercised lay functions, acting as a financier,\nwhom the se-ular laws were held to have no binding\nforce.

The stout Norman 'knights who kept guard\nin his chamber were jolly fellows, fond of good cheer\nand lusty at a song. On this weakness he began to\nplay. Sending for good wine, and giving orders to\nhis cook, he invited to his table a belt of boisterous\nknights. When the folks looked up at the keep, in\nwhich their enemy was caged, they saw lights in\nthe windows rather late, and haply went to bed, in\nthe pious hope that their bad bishop was going\nquickly to his proper doom. At length his scheme was\nripe. Asking the knights to supper he sent out for\njars of wine; a potent liquor which, in due time,\nlaid those warriors asleep on bench and floor. The\ntime was winter (the date February, 1101), the night\ncame down quickly on the Tower. When the guards\nwere all drunk, the sober bishop rose from his table,\ndrew a long coil of rope from one of the jars, passed\ninto the South room, tied his cord to the window'\nshaft, and taking his crozier with him, let himself\nrpautth et\nrr\nosshtoyr ts,e\nravnado\nths o\nwhofell\ndown.

Majesty's Tower\n\nATTEMPT TO RESCUE A DESLI:I=Z FROM\n\nTUE PoiALE\u2018\n\nCornelius Carle'on, a man of gentlemanly appear-\nance, a civil engin er, staying at\u2022 the Basinglaall\nHotel, was chargad at Bow-street, on the 17th inst.,\nwith assaulting Police constab.e \u2022 H`Queen and at-\ntempting to rescue a prisoner named Thomas William\nClifford from the custody cl that officer. The officer,\n3.l`Queen, said Clifford was a deserter from H.M.S.\nCornwallis at Plymouth, and was comraitLed from\nWandsworth that afternoon, and Groves, anoiher\npoliceman, was instructed to take him to Woolwich.\nGroves was in unform. As Clifford was violent, wit-\nness, who was in private clothes, was instructed to\naccompany and assist Groves. As they were convey-\ning the deserter from Northumberland House the pri-\nsoner rushed up and seized witness by the throat, ex-\nclaiming, \"What are you going to do with this\nman ?\" The prisoner, from the commencement of the\ncase, exhibited great excitement, agitation, and con-\nfusion, and Sir Thomas Henry was obliged to check\nhim. The witness went on to say that the prisoner\nattempted to rescue the deserter, and -called upon the\nby-standers to assist, addressing them as \"brothers,\"\nand demanding whether they would allow a fellow-\ncreature, innocent of any crime, to be dragged away\nto a dungeon? Clifford, encouraged by this attempt\nto rescue him, tried desperately to get away, and\nseverely wounded Grove's face with his handcuffs.\nUltimately Carleton was given in custody. . The\nofficer Groves, and another witness, an accidental\npasser-by, corroborated. The prisoner said he had\nonly done his duty, as England expected of every\nman, and as Lord Nelson had done. It would be his\nduty to interfere if a man was about to be shot in the\nstreet. It was well known that in the present critical\nstate of politics in England the police were in the\nconstant habit of arresting persons, and instead of\ndetaining them, or preferring any charge against\nthem, the officers privately assassinated them. Sir\nThomas Henry\u2014How could you know that he was\nnot in lawful custody under a Warrant? The pri-\nsoner\u2014Let me see the warrant. Sir Thomas Henry\u2014\nI have objection. The prisoner, after reading the\nwarrant, declared, in a patronising manner, that it\nWas \"quite correct.\" Sir Thomas Henry\u2014Then you\nsee you were in the wrong? The prisoner\u2014Oh, dear,\nno. Sir Thomas Henry said he must remand him.\nPrisoner\u2014Remand me! lam a man now. Sir\nThomas Henry\u2014l shall have you put back till the\n26th inst. The prisoner\u2014Oh! detain me. I thought\nYOU were joking. Sir Thomas Henry\u2014Remand is the\nusual term. After the prisoner's removal, Sir Thomas\nHenry observed that it would have been better not to\nhave brought a desperate man, handcuffed, through\nthe streets in open day from Victoria-to Charing-cross.\n\nWOUNDING WITH INTENT TO MURDER.\nThomas Connel, a respectable-looking man, was\nindicted at the Central Criminal Court AI the 16th\ninst.' for feloniously wounding Mary Ann Beckett,\nWith intent to murder her. In a second count it was\nalleged that he intended to do her grievous bodily\nharm. Mr. Brindley prosecuted. The prisoner had\nbeen living with the prosecutrix, a widow, and on the\nnight of the 4th of May they went to bed together.\nDuring the night the prisoner got up and cut her throat\nwith a knife' inflicting a very dangerous wound. She\nthen ran out, and was taken to the hospital, were she\nreceived immediate medical attention, and she had\nsince recovered from the injuries that had been inflicted\nUpon her. The prisoner also cut his own throat, but\nhad since recovered. It appeared that there had been\na quarrel between them, in consequence of the prisoner\nhaving found the prosecutrix in bed with another man\non the previous Friday. The prisoner's father and\nbrother were called, and stated that he had been in the\narmy ten years, and received his discharge in 1868.\nSince then he had occasionally been employed as a\nprinter. His mother and aunt had been insane, and\nhis own mind had become affected since his return\nfrom India with his regiment, where he had suffered\nfrom sunstroke. Mr. Jonas, the governor of Newo-ate,\nstated that he had had the prisoner under his charge\nfor four or five weeks, and had observed nothing in\nhis conduct that would lead him to suppose him of un-\nsound mind. The prisoner addressing the jury, said\nhe was sitting up cutting his tobacco, when the prose-\ncutrix kept pulling his shirt, and he, forgetting he had\na knife in his hand, made a \" hit \"at her. If he had\nhad any murderous intent he could have prevented her\nleaving the room. The jury found the prisoner guilty\non the second count, and recommended him to\nmercy. The learned judge commented upon the enor-\nmity of the crime he had committed and the serious\nconsequences that might have followed, and sentenced\nhim to five years' Penal servitude.\n","47646":"DEATH OF THE DEAN OF DURHAM.\n\nThe Very Rev. George Waddington, Dean of Dur-\nham' died on the 20th inst., at the age of seventy-six.\nThe deceased graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge,\nand gained numerous University honours. He was\nmedallist 1811, University Scholar and Chancellor's\nmedallist for English verse in 1813; B.A. and Senior\nChancellor's medallist in 1815.

A number of\ncarriages were drawn up on the open space known as\nthe Piazzone, a favourite rendezvous in which gentle-\nmen are accustomed to proceed from one equipage to\nanother chatting with their friends, or presenting\ntheir compliments to ladies of their acquaintance.\nThe Marquis Alessandro Covino was standing at the\ndoor of the Countess Gherardi's landau, when the\nhorses of another vehicle taking fright, started off,\nand before the Marquis could get out of the way,\nknocked him down, and so fearfully injured him with\ntheir hoofs that he expired a few minutes after. The\ndeceased was about forty years of age, and the pos-\nsessor of a handsome fortune.\nSMOCKING ACCIDENT AT LLANDUDNO.\u2014This water-\ning place was on the 18th inst. the scene of a shocking\naccident. About five o'clock a jeweller named Griffiths,\naged 35 years, left his residence with a friend for the\npurpose of taking a walk round the Ormeshead.\nWhen about two miles round Mr. Griffiths dropped\nhis walking stick down the bank, and while descend-\ning in search of it he lost his hold and began rolling\ndown. His companion went to his aid, and found him\nclinging to a piece of rock that overhangs a precipice.\nHe gave Mr. Griffiths his handkerchief as a support\nuntil aid could be received, but the poor man could\nnot retain his hold many moments, and, letting go, he\nwas dashed on the rocks nearly twenty yards below.\nThe alarm was given in the town, and police-serjeant\nJones, with four boatmen, took a boat to the spot.\nThe body was found dreadfully mangled, and brought\nto the town.

It might be\nsaid that these things would tend to provoke a desire\nfor vengeance and increase the chances of war. This\nwas, he said, to the last degree improbable. There\nwere millions of men in Lancashire who had had no\nkind of sympathy with the views he condemned, and\nthere were securities for peace in America itself. He\nbelieved there was a war party in the United States\u2014\nthe Irish party, but that was the only war party, and\nthe real power in the States was with another claqs.\nThe root of all these unfortunate circumstances was, he\nsaid, a feeling of jealousy entertained in this country\ntowards the American nation\u2014a feeling which would\nnot overthrow the decrees of nature.\u2014Lord Palmerston\ndenied that there existed in this country a jealousy of\nAmerica. No doubt, during the contest now going on\nin that country, there was a feeling of irritation in both\nNorth and South that this country, a third party, had\nnot espoused their cause; but ho believed that among\nthe great bulk of the people of the United States there\nwas a good feeling towards this country, and that when\nthe present contest was over that natural feeling would\nprevail over any temporary irritation. But this was\nno reason why we should not place our colonies in\nAmerica in a state of defence. He could not agree\nwith Mr. Lowe, and it was not the intention of the\nGovernment to follow his advice. He added, in con-\nclusion, that the relations of the two Government were\nperfectly friendly.\u2014The debate upon this subject here\nterminated.\n\nHOUSE OF LORDS.\u2014MARcii 14.\n\nBILLS.\u2014The Bankruptcy and Insolvency (Ireland)\nAct Amendment Bill w is referred to a Select Committee;\nand the British Caffi aria Pill and the Election Petitions\nAct Amendment Bill passed through Committee.\nTHE CASE OF MARY RYAN.\u2014Lord Westmeath drew\nattention to the papers presented in the case of Mary\nRyan.

He th\u2022ught\nthe young woman had been cruelly used, and, though\nit had been asserted she was mad, it had not been atis-\nfactorily proved. He complained also that some oi the\ndocuments necessary to the proper understanding of\nthe case had been kept back.

But the practice,\nthough usual, was really illegal. In this ca=e, however,\nevery facility had been given to the investigation\ndirected by the Government, and it had been fully\nascertained that the young woman was insane. She was\nwell taken care of, and, as the parties who had removed\nher did not appear to have been actuated by improper\nmotives, it had not been thought expedient to prosecute\nthem.\u2014Lord Malmesbury was convinced by a perusal\nof the papers that Mary Ryan was mad, and that the\nGovernment had done all it could to invest.gate the\nease. The parties had no doubt acted in iAnDrance of\nthe law of the country, but in some instances, as\n.when\nmagistrates sent persons to lunatic asylumns without\n-sufficient inquiry, such ignorance deserved a public\nreproof from the Home Secretary. A private rebuke\nwas useless. In this respect he thought the case had\nbeen treated too lightly.\nHOUSE OF COMMONS.\n\nTzrz BUDGET.--In reply to Mr. J.

Sir George Grey,\nreplying to a question put by Mr. Scully, relative to the\nremoval of the Irish nun, Mary Ryan, to a madhouse\nin Belgium, said it was illegal by force to remove a\nlunatic from the country, and thereby deprive him or\nher of the protection of our laws. Mary Ryan having\nbeen illegally removed, her Majesty's Government were\nprepared to request, the Belgian Government, who\nwere quite ready to accede to the request. to send her\nback, provided her eondition were such as to justify her\nremoval; but it appeared that in her present state it\nWould be highly injudicious to do so._ _ _\n\nTHE CASE OF PRINCE AZP:EM JAIL-Sir F. Ksll y\nmoved for a select committee to inquire into the claim\nof Prince Azeem Jab to the title and dignity of Nawab\nof the Carnatic, and the claims of his Highness, under\na treaty entered into in 1801 between the East India\nCompany and Prince Azeem-ul-Dowl th. Looking at\nthe nature of the questions involved in this case, he\nonly asked, he said, that, in order that there should be\na full and fair inquiry into all the circumstances, it\nshould be referred to a select committee, so that the\nHouse and the Government might be able to do justice to\nthis unfortunate Prince. The real question, which arose\nout of a certain alleged treasonable correspondence dis-\ncovered in 1799, WAS whether it was of such a character as\nte justify the East India Company in at once deposing the\nNawab in 1855. Sir Fitzroy entered into a long and minute\nhistory of transactions connected with the Carnatic,\ncommencing more than a century ago, up to the treaty\nof 1801, with the then Nawab Azeem-ul-Dowlah.\nSupposing, he said, that the Company would have been\njustified in deposing the Newel) Wallaj th, upon_ the\ndiscovery of the correspondence, or Omdut Omrah,\nhis successor, the question wag --Whether, under the\ntreaty of 1801, the Navratec-Amenvul-Dowlah was re-\ncognised as heredity\u2014successor to a transmis ible title\nanelsara7l.teYesCi\u2022 only as possessor of the rank for his life.\nThis was a question\u2014the legal construction of the treaty\n\u2014which that House' he observed, was not a proper\ntribunal to decide. He cited documents to show tint\nthe treaty was understood to convey a recognition of the\nhereditary dignity in the Nawab, a construction which\nseemed to be con firmed by the succession to the Musnud of\nthe eldest son of A zem-ul-Dowlah, on the death of the\nlatter in 1819.\u2014The motion was seconded by Mr.\nSmollett in a long speech, in which he denounced the\n\"Carnatic transaction\" as an act of grave injustice,\nreflecting discredit upon the authors.\u2014Sir E. Dering\ndefended Lord Harris against charges made by Mr.\nSmollett, complaining, with some warmth, of the\nunmeasured terms in which he had impugned the con-\nduct of that nobleman when Governor of Madras with\nreference to the treaty of 1801; and he appealed to\nevidence which showed that that treaty was considered\nto confer no right of hereditary succession, but was a\npurely personal engagement. He thought Sir F.\nKelly bad not made out any substantial ground\nfor the appointment of a committee. After a\nfew observations by Mr. Vansittart and Mr. Neate,\nthe Solicitor- General observed that the maintenance\nin India of a number of nomin 11 Sovereigns\nwas an admitted evil, and their abolition was beneficial\nto the people of India, and did harm or injury to no\nhuman being. Then were we, notwithstanding, bound\nto perpetrate the evil? It was said that we were\nbound by the treaty of 1801. He contended that the\nterms of the treaty bore no such construction; that it\nwas not the intention of the treaty; on the contrary,\nthat it was framed expressly for the purpose of excluding\nthe possibility of such an interpretation. He proceeded\nto show that there had been a clear case of treachery on\nthe part of the Nawabs of the Carnatic; that a cone-\nsuondence of a treisonable character between\nWallajah and Omdut-ul Omrah and Tippoo Sultan\nhad been discovered which gave us the right\nand the power to depose the Nawab. He ex-\nplained the grounds of the treaty of 1801, which\nwas a personal treaty, under which it was intended\nthat the then Nawab, Azeem-ul-Dowlah, should hold\n1 the title by permission of the East India Company, ant\nI not by hereditary right, which could be claimed neither\nby the letter or spirit of the treaty, nor by the\nintention of its framers. He insisted that the House\n' could decide upon the case, and that nothing but evil\ncould result from the appointment of a committee.\u2014\nMr. Ilenne,sy observed that only inquiry was asked\nfor, and he was surprised that the Government\nresisted it.\u2014Mr. Dunlop thought it was a case for\ninquiry.\u2014Mr. H. Seymour opposed the motion. He\n, thought that neither on legal grounds nor upon the\nground of expo lieney could the motion for an inquiry\nIby a commit tee be maint tined. At the same time, the\nEsst India-offi-e should, in his opinion, take the case of\n' this unfortunate family into consideration.\u2014After a few\nwords by Mr. Ingham, Sir C. Wood justified the policy\nand justice of the course which had been taken in the\ncase of the Carnatic family upon public as well as\nspecial grounds, and insisted that it bad been attended\nwith no breach of faith. He gave a short hiatory of\nthe transactions which resulted in the treaty of\n1801, and an explanation of its object, which was,\nafter the Carnatic had been forfeitsd by the family,\nto give to the then Nawab Azeem-ul-Dowlah the\n' title for life only, the words \" him and his heirs,\" and\nI all terms implying Perpetuity, being intentionally\nomitted. He cited the opinions of Indian statesmen\nand other authorities adverse to any claim of heriditary\nright in his descendants.\u2014The discussion was continued\n! by Colonel Dickson and Colonel Sykes.\u2014Upon a\ndivision the motion was negatived by 53 to 38.\nI EDUCATION.\u2014The &lea Committee On Education\nwas nominated.\n\nOUR RELATIONS WITH AMERICA.\u2014On the order for I\ngoing into a Committee of Supply, Mr. S. Fitzgerald\ncalled attention to the report of Colonel Jervois with\nreference to the defences of Canada, and asked for in-\nformation with reference thereto. After clearing himself\nfrom false imputations in taking this course, and\ndisclaiming any intention to attribute to the Federal\nGovernment or to the people generally a spirit of\nhostility towards this country, he suggested certain\npossible contingencies which might lead to hostilities\nbetween this country and the United States, and against\n'which we should not, he said, shut our eyes, nor dis-\nregard a certain proposal made during the recent\nconference between the Confederate agents and the\nFederal authorities. Under these circumstances, it was\nof importance to look to the defence of Canada, upon\nwhich in the event of war the first blow would fall,\nand, as no one would advise that the colony should\nbe left to defend itself in a quarrel in which it would\nbe involved solely on account of its connection with\nthis country, he proceeded to consider what were its\nmeans of defence and what it should be our duty to\ncontribute towards its defences, the state of which he\ndescribed. He referred to the proposals containi-\nthe report of Colonel Jervois, and askred2v,h_all;teps had\nbeen taken by the Goverup2ate fue carry out these pro-\nposals, and to aueTeceilt the defensive resoarces of the\nl coony\n- compared the activity of the Americans in\ntortifYing all their vulnerable points with the apathy\nmanifested by us in altogether neglecting the defences\nof our most vulnerable point, Canada. He urged\nthis as a matter, he said, of pressing and p iramount\nnecessity, and that unless we set to work vigilantly,\nand came to an immediate understanding with ,\nCanada as to the proportion this country should. '\nbear of the cost of its means of defence, the conse-\nquences would be fatal.\u2014Mr. W. Forster believed that\nthe fears of hostilities on the part of the United States '\nwere unreasonable and utterly groundless, and he drew\nfrom some of the facts referred to by Mr. Fitzgerald\nconclusions consistent with pacific and friendly feelings\non the part of that Government towards this country.\nWhy, then be asked, should there be this extraordinary\nsuspicion Of America? It arose, he said, from the\nefforts of two classes,\u2014one consisting of Confederate\nagents and sympathisers; the other of disappointed\nprophets. Having insisted upon the groundlessness of\nthe fears of war with America, he protested against ;\nrushing into an enormous expense for the defence of\nCanada.\u2014Mr. Cardwell said he could assure the House,\nwithout reserve' that our relations with the United\nStates continued to be perfectly friendly. But, what-\never might be the prospect of our future relations with\ntheir Government, it was not upon the forbearance of\nother countries that reliance was placed, but upon our\nown inherent strength. Those who went to war with\nCanada went to war with England. The Government\nwere prepared to do their part in the defence of Canada,\nbut it was their opinion, and they had strongly expressed\nit, that the main defence of the colony should be found in\nthe spirit and energy of the people, and he had the satis-\nfaction of stating that efforts, which might have been made\nearlier, were now making in the colcry with the best pos-\nBible spirit.\u2014Mr. Disraeli, after paying a tribute to the ,\nmanner in which the Federal Government had conducted\ntheir relations with this country under circumstances\nof great difficulty, avowed his opinion that we were in\nno immediate danger of com;ng into collision with that\nGovernment, because he believed that the people of the\nUnited States were a sagacious people, and were not\nlikely to engage in another struggle with a foreign\n'Power. There were other reasons (which he explained)\nthat induced him to adopt this opinion. There were\nelements in operation which would hereafter work an\nalteration in the United States, and our North American\ncolonies would become a powerful federation. He\nurged that our relations with those dependencies\ndemanded serious consideration. To abandon them\nwould be a disastrous and fatal step. Then, what\nshould be our course? To place them in a state of\nproper defence. He referred to the inconsistent con-\nduct of the Government in this matter. .11e did not,\nhe said, blame them fcr being inconsistent, but he la-\nmented the consequence of discordant opinions\u2014that\nthe colonies had not been defended.\u2014Mr. Lowe said he\nShould confine himself to the simple question, what this\ncountry ought to do and was bound to do. Suppose we\nwere actually at war with the United States, Colonel\nJervois stated that our troops would be obliged to flee\nto their ships, and therefore we should make fortifica-\ntions. But if we had fortifications the troops would be\ndriven into them. There was no conceivable disparity\nof numbers which the Araertans might not bring to\noverwhelm them. No fortifications could be held\nagainst this force aided by modern\nartillery, so that if\nour troops were driven into the t\u2022 or c-ta,oris it would\nbe impossible for them to escape. The question was,\nwhat should be done if Canada was the battle-\nground in case of war. The most effectual\ncourse in such an event would be to ewe_\nceptrate a force upon some other point. His conclusion,\ntherefore, was that it would be unwise to retain any\nforce worth speaking of in Canada. Then, if we should\nnot keep troops there in time of war, why in time of\npeace? We had better let Canada know the truth, and.\nnot buoy her up with false expectations, while we pro-\nvoked America by a standing menace. The wisest course\nwould be at once to withdraw our troops.\u2014After obser-\nvations by Sir J. Fergusson, Mr. J. White, Mr. C.\nFortescuo, Sir F. Smith, Mr. Watkin, Sir M. Farquhar,\nLord Elcho, Mr. Ayrton, and Lord R. Cecil, Mr. Bright\nsaid the question was at once important anti delicate.\nThe difficulty was that we had an extensive colony lying\nadjacent to the -United States, and, if there be a war party\n\nHOUSE OF COMMONS.\u2014IIIAncu 15.\nPUBLICHOCSE ACT AMENDMENT Cox said\nhe would postpone the second reading of this bill till\n]Star ch 30.\nitlEs IN CRIMINAL CASES BILL.\u2014Sir C.

J. Carttar, coroner for West Kent, resumed\nand concluded an inquiry at the Pier Tavern, Elite, on\nMarch 13, relative to the melam_holy accident which\noccurred by the upsetting of a boat in the Thames on\nthe 28th February, in consequence of which ten cadets,\nbelonging to the training ship Worcester, lost their\nlives. Mr. Henry Green, chairman; Mr. Chamberlain,\ndeputy chairman; Mr. Bullivant, seretary ; and other\ngentlemen connected with the seciety, attended to\nwatch the proceedings, and the inquest room was\ncrowded.\nMr. Tipple, surgeon, of Erith, said that he saw the\nbody of the deceased Cadet Harrison immediately\nafter it was landed. Death was caused by drowning.\nBenjamin Joseph Beckwith, aged 17, cadet on board\nthe Worcester training ship, explained how the boat\ngot capsized. The incidents are already well known.\nWitness jumped into the river as the boat was turning\nover, and was afterwards picked up. He could swim,\nand when he rose on the top of the water he saw some\nof the other lads swimming, and heard one cry out that\nhe had got the cramp. The boys were not looking\nover the side of the boat, and there was no larking\ngoing on. Witness had known the boat eight or nine\nmonths, and considered that she was an excellent\nboat in every respect. When the boat was wearing\nCashman told one of the lads to loosen the foresail,\nand he let it go. This had nothing to with the\naccident, and would rather tend to have prevented it.\nBy the jury: Johnson, the cadet who was lost whilst\ntrying to save others, could swim. All the cadets were\ntrained to The art of swimming.\nJames Awdry, another cadet, aged 16, gave corrobo-\nrative evidence, and in reply to the coroner said he\ncould not tell why the boat capsized. At the time of\nthe accident the head of the boat was towards the north\nshore. Witness could swim, and was swimming when\nhe was picked up. After she capsized the boat partly\nrighted herself again, and a great many of the cadets\nwere clinging to her, when she turned over again\ncompletely.\nJames Palmer, a cadet, gave similar evidence.\nCaptain George Whitby, commander of the Worces-\nter, was then examined, and said he saw the three\nboats leave the vessel. The boat which capsized was\nthe largest. It was purchased by the society in Sep-\ntember last from the Boat Building Company at East\nGreenwich. She was 29 feet long, 6 feet 7 inches in\nthe beam, and appeared to be an excellent boat in\nevery respect. Cashman, the boatswain, was in charge\nof this boat. Cashman joined the ship in August last.\nHe had previouily had many years' experience, and\nwitness had always considered him to be a most efficient\nas he was a most trustworthy man. He first received\ninformation of the a,ccident from a screw steamer,\nwhich hailed him when going down the river.\nBy the Coroner: He never sent ballast in the boat ;\nhe did not approve of that plan\u2014in fact, considered it\ndangerous, and that many lives had been lost by\nplacing ballast in bolts. The majority of the cadets on\nboard the Worcester could swim. He inspected the\nsails of the boat when they were being made. He did\nnot think that the boat was over-canvassed. The sails\nwere made of very light canvas.\nJames Sims, a waterman, of Greenwich, who was\nnear the spot where the accident took place, in his\nboat, said: Immediately before she capiz, d he saw\nthat the boat was on the starboard tack, with her head\nright down. He saved three persons, and got the\ndeceased Cadet Harrison into his boat, but he appeared\nthen to be lifeless. He saved Cashman, who called\nout, \"Never mind me; I am all right; save the\nothers.\" He did not think that the boat could have\nturned quite keel upwards, as the sails would not have\nallowed it. The wind was fresh. Witness never\ncarried ballast in his boat, and did not approve of that\nplan.\nThe men who had charge of the two other boats were\nexamined, but their testimony was unimportant.\nJohn Cashman, the boatswain in charge of the cap-\nsized boat (having been duly cautioned by the coroner),\nsaid he wished to state all that he knew respecting the\naccident. He had been nineteen years is. her Majesty's\nservice before he joined the 'Worcester. Immediately\npreceding this engagement he was a gunner on board\nthe President training-ship for the Naval Reserve.\nAfter repeating the evidence given as to the arrival of\nthe boat at Crossness Point, the witness said: When\none of the cadets lost his cap, be told a lad named\nHolmes to ea.e the foresheet, and Holmes let go the\nsheet altogether. That rather helped witness than\notherwise in the movement he intended to make in\norder to get the cap. Up to the time of tbo accident\nthe boat had behaved well, and had not shipped more '\nthan a quart of water. Before the accident he was on\nthe port tack, standing over to the opposite shore. He\nwore the boat about till she came round on the starboard\ntack, when the wind took her on the starboard quarter,\nand she went down instantly. He could not account\nfor the boat going over in any way.\nBy the Jury: She was keel uppermost before he told\nthe cadets to cling to her; finding there was no other\nchance he called out to the cadets in the water, \"Strike\nout for the boat,\" and he believed they all did so.\nThere were not too many lads in the boat; hstd there\nbeen a few more the accident might not have happened,\nas thep would have acted as ballast. He did not approve\nof taking ballast in the boat. Now that the accident\nbn taken place, he thought it would be better that the\nkeel of the boat should be a little deepened. He had\nalways considered her a very safe boat.\nThe jury, without consultation, returned a verdict of\n\"Accidental death.\"\n","120891":"FOREIGN.\n\nThe King of Portugal, it is said in Paris, has addressed\na letter to the Marquis de Loulti, Minister of Foreign\nAffairs, contradicting the rumour that he had accepted\nthe crown of Spain.

The late accident occurred in a mine with\nbut one shaft, and round the mouth of the shaft there\nwas a large pile of wcoden buildings, containing stores,\nhoisting machinery, and so on, dry as tinder under the\nlo::g drought. It caught fire, and the fire communica-\nted with the mine; and, there being no other outlet,\neven for ventilation, the men were crowded into one\ncorner, and miserably perished.\n\nM.

Sir F. R.\nSandford presided, and after expressing hie pleasure at\nthe large attendance at the confeience stated,. on behalf\nof the committee, the warm interest they felt in the\nphysical education of the members of institutions- in\nunion with the association. He would requeet Mr. IL\nH. Sales, their secretary, to introduce the subjects for\ndiscussion. Mr. Sales, stiter having descrileelthe origin\nof the annual fete in 1864, and the great success that\nattended it,. and also that of last yi ar, noticed in detail\nthe arrangements hitherto made and the alterations\npreposed. lin the sports, it was suggested i a wider\ndistinction between urban and suburban societies\nshould be made, so ae- to put competitors on a\nmore equal footing. The judges h?cl hitherto been\nprofessional men, but it had been thought advisable to\nretain the services of military men. In cons euence of\nthe small number of entries for the band contest, he\nsuggested its discontinuance. At the flmstfte, an open-\nair concert of 800 voices was given, but the result was\nso unsatisfactory that it was not renewed. This year\nan in-door concert on a large scale was propo-ed. The\n, other details of the fife, such as the balloon ascent,\nentertainments by professional gymnasts (under the\ndirection of Mr. Nelson Lee), diAribution of prizes,\nand other matters, would not need discussion, Captain\nMacgregor did not approve of military judges,\nas equally efficient men could be obtained\nfrom the ranks of the volunteers. He- strongly\nurged the encouragement of those spoits that did\nnot require much spice, HO that mernb rs need\nnot go from their institutions to practice. A rowing\nmatch, be considerel, would not only be attractive but\nprofitable. The delegate from the Duck-lane Club said\nthat although he was charged to make sundry objec-\ntions, he Was first instructed to express the-great satis-\nfaction of his club at the way in which the affairs of\npreceding fetee had been managed by the officers of the\nassociation. He urged most strongly a more equitable\ncompetition in the sports, so that the old men might\nhave a chance. He was turned fifty, and could not\nrun a mile race,, but he challenged any other man\nnot younger to- a 300 yards' spin, and hoped there\nwould be something this year for men between\nfifty and ninety. The delegate from Greville\nHouse lustitution suegested larger- prizes in\nsome events. The delegate from the West London\nYouths' Institute holed that silver medals and cups\nwould be substituted for mon,py prizes. Illtimately, on\nthe mot on of the.delegate-froAn the London Mechanics'\nInstitution, secondmit by the delegate from the Stor-\nmont House Club, it was resolved to appoint a sports\ncommittee, to consist of a delegate from each institu-\ntion. At the conclusion of the conference a selection\nof glees and part songs were sung by a choir consisting\nof members of various societies, under the able direction\nof the Rev. G. B. Macilwiin. Sir F. R. S tndford\nthanked the conductor and choir, eseecielly Mr. Heller,\nwho had so carefully trained the greatest number, for\ntheir efficient and pleasing services;, and on the motion\nof the Rev.

Here there was no contributory negligenee (as.\n1 is not unfrequently alleged in some cases of this kind)\non the part at the company's servants. The acc'dent,\nit appeared, arose entirely from the passenger's own\nrashness. Against the London and 13.ighton Company\nthere was but one action' which was brought by the\nwidow of a labourer who had been killed on the line.\nA verdict, in that case was given against thc company for\n\u00a3l5O. The London, Chatham, and Dover Company\nalso had but one action against them brought\nto trial. That was a case of personal injury by collision,\nand the damages awarded were \u00a3250. There\nwere three actions against the Great Eastern\nCompany, in which the damages given were\nrespectively \u00a34OO, \u00a32OO, mad \u00a32OO. Against\nthe South Eastern there Were three actions\u2014one arising\nout of the accident in Blackheath tunnel, in December,\n1864, and in respect of which a verdict passed against\nthe company for \u00a31,200; and two others, which arose\nout of the Staplehurst accident iu June last. One of\nthese, in which \u00a34OO damages were awardedr was\nbrought by a father and mother for the loss of a son,\nin whom they had a pecuniary interest, and who had\nbeen killed by an accident on the company's line. The\nother action was for injuries sustained by a. husl- and\nand. wife. The husband being a clergyman. In this\ncase it appeared that the medical expenses alone\namounted to \u00a35OO. The verdict against the company,\nwho, upon the question, of negligence did not deny\ntheir liability, was for \u00a34,500. The Great Western\nCompany were deferldants in five actions one\nby a widow for the loss of her husband,, an engineer,\nearning \u00a35OO a year, in which a verdict was\ntaken, by consent, for \u00a31,850; the others were\nfor personal injuries,, in one of which the verdict was\nfor the company. In the others, the damag( s given\nwere respectively \u00a35,775, \u00a31,600, and \u00a3702 10s. In\nthe only action against the Bristol and Exettr Railway\na verdict, by consent, was given for \u00a32,262. Against\nthe Midland Company thee were feta astions ; in one\nof which a verd;ct was given for \u00a3BOO, in respect of a per-\nsonal injury arising out of the collision last year at Colney\nHatch, where, it will be remembered, 300 passengers\nwere more or less injured. In the second action (also\nfor a personal injury) the verdict was for \u00a3250. In the\nother two cases the company obtained the verdicts. The\nLondon and North-Western Company were defendants\nin 14 actions\u2014one for loss of lifer in which the verdict\nwas for the company, it appearing that the acci-\ndent occurred through the paesengers own incaution. In\ntwo other cases the company were successful. In one of\nthem it was proved that the parties (husband and wife)\nhad before they brought the action agreed to accept a\ncertain sum ( which was paid to them by the company)\nin full for their claim. This fact, which was pleaded\nin bar to the action, put them at once out of court.\nAnother of these 14 cases was an action by a widow for\nthe loss of her husband, a carter, who met his death by\nan accident on the line, leaving two children. The\nverdict given in that case was for \u00a33OO. The other ten\ncases against this company arose out of personal in-\njuries. The verdicts were respectively for \u00a34,000,\n\u00a33,500, \u00a3B5O, \u00a3BOO, \u00a3550, \u00a3525, \u00a35OO, \u00a34OO, \u00a3225,\nand \u00a3225. Against the London and South Western\nCompany there were three actions\u2014one for the loss of\na wife who was killed by an accident on the S disbury\nline, and in which a verdict was given for \u00a3500; one\nfor a personae injury, in 'which \u00a3550 was awarded,\nand one in which the verdict was given in\nfavour of the company. The South Devon Company\nwere defendants in one action only, which was for a\npersonal injury, and in which \u00a3550 damages were given.\nThe Great Northern aho had but one action against it,\nand in that, for a personal injury, \u00a3450 was awarded.\nThere were seven actions against the Lancashire and\nYorkshire Company, six for personal injuries, and one\nfor loss of life. The verdicts in the six cases were re-\nspectively for \u00a3l,OOO, \u00a3450, \u00a33OO, \u00a3250, \u00a32OO, and \u00a375.\nIn the other, by a widow, for the loss of her husband,\nleaving six children, the damages awarded were \u00a3750.\nAgainst the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Com-\npany there were two actions, in one of which, brought by\na mother for the loss of a son, in whom she had a pe-\ncuniary interest, the verdict was for \u00a32OO. The other\nwas a case of personal injury, in which the damages\ngiven were \u00a3450.

The ordinary coupling consists\nof draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws'\nso as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train\nclose together. There are also safety chains, one on\neach side of the main coupling. The improvement\ncomes into action the moment the engine or tender\nhappens to diverge at a certain angle from the line\nof railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of\ngear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are\ndriven back by the springs into the void left by the\ndraw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are\ninstantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame\nof the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com-\npletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears\nthat accidents from engines running off the rails amount\nto more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci-\ndents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the\nIst of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from\nthis cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas-\nsengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861\nthere were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas-\nsengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862\nthere were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and\n282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci-\ndents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail-\nway, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and\ninjury to 161 persons, making together in the course of\n3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running\noff the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63\npersons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons,\nbesides involving destruction of rolling stock and large\nsurna for compensation. This indicates to some extent\nthe advantage of adopting the system of coupling\npatented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia-\nment-street, and which appears to be very complete in\nevery respect for the purpose intended. It is in course\nof being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains\nen the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from\nthat cause have heretofore been rather more frequent\nthan on other railways A full-sized model of the\napparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament-\nstreet, which will enable those who are interested in\npreventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It\nis rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of\nrailways have no power to require the adoption of any\nimprovement that might appear to them calculatedito\nprevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although\nthey have power to prevent the opening of a railway\nfor traffic until all the requirements as to the stability\nof the works and the efficiency of the signals have been\nfully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the\nrailway department of the Board of Trade.\n\nANOTHER DANGEROUS FREAK OF A SAILOR.\u2014On the\nmorning of December 10, about four o'clock, as the mail\ntrain going north was, passing through Broughton, on\nthe Lancaster and Preston Railway., about a mile south\nof the Broughton and Barton Station, a sailor, a pas-\nal\nfull\nreipea geeds. , stepped out\nIle fell on\nos efn\nthe\ner i\ntrainu on one\nso of thew asee cgoingon dt\nclasse carriages,\nthe line, but fortunately received no further injuries\nthan slight bruises on one shoulder and, one knee. There\nwere three other sailors in the same compartment, and\nall of them having been partaking rather too freely of\ngrog, they had been fast asleep.. One of them awaken-\ning, being under the impression that he was at his\njourney's end, got up with the intention of alighting,\nand stepped out, but was surprised on finding himself\ncast to the ground with much force. On recovering\nfrom the shock of his fall, he saw the signal light off\nthe station at Barton ahead, and made his way thither,\nand related to the astonished station master his adven-\nture. He remained at the station about fourhours, until\nthe arrival of the next train which stopped there when\nhe was sent onwards. Except that no startling there,\nof\na Muller-like catastrophe followed the discovery of the\nsailor having fallen from the carriage, the incident is\nsomething like one which occurred on the London and\nNorth Western Railway, a few days ago, when a drunken\n' sailor fell out of the train when at full speed, and his\ncompanions were apprenended on the charge of murder,\nand were only released on their companion appearing in\npropria persona, and unhurt, to tell the Pile\u00b0 he had\nnot been murdered.\nTHE PEACE ADDRESS TO THE -UNITED STATBS.\nWashington dispatch says :\u2014About six weeks ago, Mr.\nJoseph Parker, of Manchester, England, arrived at\nNew York, bringing with him the peace address of the\nsubjects of Great Britain and Ireland, with a letter\nfrom Sir Henry de lloughton to Governor Seymour,\nwho declined formally to receive it, ;\nase.gning as a\nreason that it should be given to the President of the\nUnited States, the latter being the only authorised\nchannel of communication between other nations and\nthe citizens of the United States. Mr. Parker, having\narrived here last week, addressed a note to Secretary\nSeward, stating that he had been deputed to this coun-\ntry to convey the address to the people of the United\nStates, and asking the honour of an oPPertunity of\npresenting it to the President. To this the secretary\nreplied that, before answering the letter, it was desir-\nable to be further informed whether Mr. Parker had\nany authority from the Government of Great Britain\nand Ireland for the purpose referred to, and whether\nhis mission had been made known to the diplomatic\nagent of that government near the e\nbevernment of\nthe United States. Mr. Parker replied bY saying that\nthe address he had the honour of bringing to this\ncountry, containing the signatures. of 350,000 of his\ncountrymen, from the peer to the artisan, was not from\nthe Government of Great Britain, nor from any political\nparty. It was simply an expression of the earnest\ndesire of Great Britain to see Peace restored to this\ncountry. The correspondence closed by a note from\nthe Secretary of State, in which he said the Govern-\nment of the United States could not receive the\naddress, and that the request for an interview with the\nPresident was, therefore, declined. The intention now\nis to present the address to Congress at the approaching\nsession. \u2022\nMATTHEWS AND THE REWARD.\u2014.There is RO truth\nin the watement that Matthews has received the\nreward offered for the conviction of Muller. The\nrailway company and the bank have handed over their\nrespective sums to Sir Richard Mayne, and when\nGovernment have added their portiun, the question of\nhow the money should be divided will then come under\nconsideration. It is said, however, that it will be\nequally divided between Mr. Death; Matthews, and the\ntwo Repsches. Inspector Tanner will not, as is gene-\nrally supposed, Come in for any portion of the reward.\nIn fact, beyond his salary, there is no recognition of the\nservices rendered by this intelligent officer, and unless\nthe public think proper to accord him some mark of\ntheir approbation he will go unrewarded. \u2022\n\nBREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE.\nIn the Court of C..ommen- Pleason December 10, an\naction\u2014Wylie v.

The de-\nfendant, by his plead', gs, denied the promise, anal\nalsl alleged that a roast) ,able time for the ,performanoe\nof the promise had not been a lowed.\nMr. Gitiard and Mr. rll.l,,chlan were for the plaintiff;\nMr. Phil brick for the defendant,\nMr. G.ffard said he oelieved he could fully establish\nboth the promise, and the refusal to perform it, and that\nthe only question for the jury would be the amount of\ndamages. The plaintiff, Mrs. Elizabeth Mary Wylie,\nwas a widow. The oefendant was a grocer at South\nNorwood. The plaintiff had for some time been employed\nas a housekeeper; and it was through the defendant\nbeing in want of a houskeeper that he first met Mrs.\nWylie. He was gre aly taken with her. They\nbecame intimate, and at length the defendant engaged\nto marry the plaintiff on Cioydan :Fair day. The\ndefendant was a widower, between 50 and 60 years of\nage, with a grown up family, and after having engaged\nhimself to the plaintiff he introduced her to his family,\nand afterwards gave her to understand that they were\ngreatly p'eased with her. The letters which he had\nwritten to her would clearly show the relation in which\nthey stood. The learned gentleman then read the\nfollowing letters addressed by the defendant to the\nplaintiff:\u2014\n\n\"5, Porthurl road, South Norwood,\nAugust 10, 1864.\n\"My dearest Mrs. W,\u2014l arrived home quite safe\nabout eleven o'clock last evening. lam very pleased\nto say that I feel all the better for my trip, but did not\nlike parting with you, and watched you as far as I\ncould see you, but could not get you to look back after\npoor me.

In another letter he said,\n\"I do not think it is possible for me to wait until the\nfair. lam so cold at nights that you must come and\nkeep me warm.\" (Laughter.) It would be unnecesSary\nto read more letters. He (Mr. Giflard) would show\nthat the defendant refused to perform the promise so dis-\ntinctly established by the correspondeace. The defen-\ndant had a good business, and would be able to pay\nsubstantial damages. The lady being'3B, it might be\nthought her feelings were less acute than those of a\nyoung maiden; but it may be considered that this was\npossibly her last chance. (Laughter.)\nMr. Greenwood, the plaintiff's attorney, was called,\nand stated that after his first letter on the subject of the\npromise the defendant called on him and said he could\nnot perform his promise, as his children thought the\nplaintiff too young for him. He would pay the expense\nof cheap lodgings for Mrs. Wylie until she got a situ-\nation. He wished to see the plaintiff privately, but\nhe (the witness) would only agree to this on condition\nthat the meeting took place at his own office. In his\nre-examination, he stated that his reason for this was\nthat the plaintiff had told him the defendant had be-\nhaved improperly to her when they were alone.\nMr. Philbrick then addressed the jury for the defend-\nant, and said that he should be able to satisfy them\nthat the plaintiff had conseeted to the marriage not\n\u2022 taking place until a later period than stated, and that\nthis action was brought too soon, as a reasonable time\nfor the marriage had not arrived when the action was\ncommenced.\nTwo witnesses were called, a tailor and his wife, of\nwhom the defendant had ordered the clothes he intended\nto be married in; but their evidence,: taken at the utmost\nvalue for the defendant, only fixed the event for some\nday subsequent to the 22nd of October, when t3ix months\nfrom the defendant's first wife's death would have\nelapse 4.\nThe Lord Chief Justice summed up the case very\ncarefully to the jury, and pointed out to them the offer\nof the defendant to ' pay for cheap lodgings for the\nplaintiff until she could get a situation\u2014\" a very\nwithering change for one who expected to be his\nwife.\"\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014\nDamages, \u00a32OO.\n\nTHE KING OF PRUSSIA AND !lIS ARMY.\u2014The King\nof Prussia has issued the following order of the day to\nthe army The glorious war against Denmark is\nended.

During,. that period also\nwe have had a ten. years' census, of the number\nof the people' and these two will give us exactly\nthe: ratio of both the increase. of 'capital and\nlabour.\n* It is strange, but it is a fact, that thw two\npositive and easily obtained relations have never\nyet been placed side by side, and we will (in\nround numbers, to avoid complicity) now for\nthe first time place the facts before our readers\nwho may then judge for themselves of the truth of\nthe so-called law, and the teachings of the\neconomic shool. The returns of the income tax\nshow that the increase of the incomes from land,\nand houses' from 1801 to 1860 is, at least, 300\nper cent. Upon incomes from trades and pro-\nfessions, more than 500 per cent., and upon\nAilways, mine S and minerals, nearly 80\nper cent. The average will be at an increase of\nwealth of fully 500 per cent in sixty years.\nThe census proves during that period, that\nthe increase of the people does not, exceed 80\nper Cent. But say 100; it will be certain that\nthe increase of population has not kept pace\nscience,\" it should\nwith the increase of wealth. Now, according to\nthe' teaching of the \"\nfollow that the distribution Of wealth in wages\nwill always equal its increase, but the candid\nand reasonable among them admit that wages\nhave not increased with wealth, in any propor-\ntionate ratio. Dr. Smiles, one of the most rabid\n'opponents to the efforts of working men to\nObtain a better share of this wealth, affirms that\nwages have advanced; but even he cannot prOve\nan ad;Vance of '25 per cent. during sixty yenta,\nincluding diminution of time, while the Doctor\ncarefully ignores the rise . Of: rents, rates, meat,\nmilk, and of raw materials in general. But,\ngranting for the sake of argument,' that wages\nhave advanced 25 per cent. to the people, what\n'ratio-doe's that bear to theincrease of wealth?\nand what does it bear upon the whole to the\nConditions of our present social relations in\ngeneral?'\n. Edwin Chadwick, the great\n.sanitary statis-\nthian, has laid it down that the death rates of\nany people and class will be a correct test of\n-their moral, as well as physical condition, and\nwe have the positive and unmistakeable, fact,\nthat where wealth has been most created, in all\nlarge manufacturing centres, the lives of the\noperative classes have been gradually diminish-\nink.\n. In some of the lake districts, in Kent and\nEssex the average deaths per 1,000 is as low as\nis ; T\n' 15 and 17; over England it -n ....encLon\ndistricts betwixt 19 and '45,\nthe average* being 24 or thereabouts; but in the\nmanufacturing districts it reaches from 26 at\nBradford' to 26 at Sheffield, 27 at Leeds, 30 at\nManchester, and in Hull 33 per 1,000. These are\naverages for years past, but mortalityis gradually\nincreasing. In Leeds, last year, the death rate\nrose to per 1,000 I while in all manufacturing\n'towns, gradually More ' die under five years of\nage, and: fewer over 70, in relation to the popu-\nlation. Among the wealthy, the contrary is the\nresult, their lives being gradually lengthening,\nand the same applies to the agricultural districts\nin general. Now these facts prove that our\nwealth manufacturing has, in its progress, very\nimequally. affected 'various classes. It has in-\ncreaed life and riches to a few, and mortality\nand relative evils fo the many; and this is the\ncause and ground of the dissatisfaction, of which\nstrikes and Trades' Unions are the external and\nvisible 'sigh'. And what -wonder ?'''\u2022 Duchatel\nsays,' ,\",.were the 'benefits of civiliSation to be\npartial, not universal, it would be only a ,\nbitter mockery and cruel -injustice.\" This is\nwhat the operative. classes feel, fmd.investigation\nonly proves the reasonablenesss . of their dis-\ncontent at such results.

Their conduct remarkably re-\nsembles a conspiracy against the law of\nthe land. Trades' societies consist with the law\nof the land and exist by its provisions. These\ngentlemen say that they cannot persuade the\nlegislature to repeal the law, thcr3fore they will\noverride all law within the smoke of their\nfurnaces, and they combine for either this anti-\nlegal or illegal purpose. Their proceedings\nconstitute a ' conspiracy, if not legally. against\nthe laiv, logically ao\u2022ainst morals and cornmon\n, sense. The extent of the combination, like the\n' depth of the Canadian rocks spoken of the\nother day at the British Association by Sir\nCharles. Lyell, is an unknown 'quantity.

She was then thrown\nunderneath the railing of the steamboat into the river.\nWitness' believed that the accident occurred in Conse-\nquence of the steamboat coming violently in collision\nwith the pier. The deceased was jerked from her seat\nby that collision. There was not the slightest chance\nfor the deceesed when she fell. There was neither\nplank, rope, or netting over the large open space at the\nend of the seats between the wooden hand-nano. and\nthe deck. The space through which the deceased fell\nwas about three feet high from the handrail to the\ndeck of the steamboat. The jury returned the follciwing\nspecial verdict:\u2014\" That the deceased came to her\ndeath by accident, and the jurors say that the open\nspace between the handrail and the deck should be\n, protected, to prevent accidents.\"\n\" ACCIDENT AT DOVER.\u2014OD gfidaynight'a tulip named\n'Mis4S.Hall, on a efiit tO'DoVer fell over the Later (a '3O\nfeet wall) into two'oi three feet water.

It consists of a couple of shafts only a few\ndozen yards apart, both of which run through a valu-\nable series of coal beds, the chief of which are the\nPember.on five feet, the Pemberton feet, and the\ncannel. This latter lies about 500 yards from the\nsurface, and in one of these two shafts\u2014that in which\nthe accident occurred\u2014the sinking to this important\nseam has progressed so favourably that but some half\ndozen yards of rubbish remained to be sent up and the\nlabours of the sinkers would have been ended. Between\n8 and 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning a party of a\ndozen men were at work in the shaft in question, when\nit was found necessary to blast a portion of the strata\nthrough which they were passing. Two-thirds of the\nworkmen were hoisted to the surface, where they were\njoined in a few moments by their companions as soon\nas they had set fire to the fuze which was to light the\npowder. The blasting seemed to take place in a proper\nmanner below, and at ten minutes to nine a party of\neight men were again lowered. The engineer was,\nhowever, astonished to find that the hoppet containing\n- ?Lit,\n,men stopped in the shaft when it was still a few\nyardi\n;',.\nthe bottom, and he was still further sur-\nprised to not e the rope swaying to and fro in the pit.\nA shout down t' nit elicited no response, and the alarm\nbecame general wh.o it was found that it was impos-\nsible even with the ti\nted strength of two engines of\nvast power to move the\nBryham the manager, an 2ther\nth2.pipset from its position. Mr.\napprised na\nof the accident, and ha.. 74 gentlemen weris\nned to t bre,\nwhere measures were soon taken team the\ntrue state of affairs below. A new rope had\nto be placed on the drum, it being found impossible\nto move the five hundred yards then in the\nshaft. By noon this was accomplished, and a hoppet\nhaving been attached to the new rope the foreman of\nthe sinkers and a couple of assistants descended the\npit to learn the fate of those below. They reported\nthat the whole of the last range of brickwork-13\nyards deep, and running entirely round the shaft, 16\nyards in diameter\u2014had fallen to the bottom, burying\ncompletely the hoppet and the men in it. Eight active\nworkmen were at once sent down, and load after load\nof debris were sent up, and after great labour succeeded\nin reaching the hoppet with the men, five of whom\nwere found to be dead, and three alive in the hoppet,\nnot much injured.\n\nTHE YEAR 1864.\n\nThe year 1864 opened with a stormy aspect for\nEurope generally, while in America there was no pros-\npect of peace. In Denmark it was clear that there\nwould presently be an invasion of the Duchies. Poland\nwas in the depths\u2014not of despair, for the Poles never\ndespair\u2014but of ruin. The Emperor of the French was\nin his balancing mood; and there was no saying what\nhe would ain about adhering to the Treaty of 1852, or\nanything else. We were in dread of evil tidings from\nvarious quarters. The little war on the north west\nfrontier of India was more serious than we had\nsupposed; and Lord Elgin's death had left the\ncountry without a ruler at a most critical time.\nThe consolation was that Sir John Lawrence was\non his way out. The New Zealand war had\nassumed a very grave appearance; and we were in sue-\nTense about what would happen in Japan after the\n--affisir of Kagosima. As for the end of these uncer-\ntainties\u2014the little war in India was soon at an end\u2014to\nbe succeeded by another on another part of our frontier.\n.Beyond the Punjaub everything is settled for the pre-\nssen ; but we have a quarrel with Bhootan, in every\nway vexatious. The New Zealand war was supposed\n.\u2022 to be over in August; but fresh menaces have arisen,\nand-we.are not much happier about that colony at the\n. close of the year than we were at the beginning. In\n\u201ejapan, the affair of Kagosima seemed rather to tend\nto peace than the contrary; but new troubles\nare always arising there when everything seems to\nbe settled; And we hardly feel more secure of a\ngood. footing and a prosperous commerce now than\nwe did twelve months ago. In China the change\nAtas been more essentOhan we expected. The taking\n\u2022 .of Nanking in July; and the breaking of the heart of\nthe rebellion by that achievement, has afforded us the\nproper opportunity for determining what we shall do,\n\u2022 and what we shall abstain from doing, in regard to the\ndifficullies of half-barbarous countries line China,\nwhen their inevitable fate overtakes them. We had\ndeclined interference in Mexico, and the procession of\nevents there has satisfied us with our decision. We\nhave seen the French occupation becoming fear-\nfully costly in all ways: we have s.len the new\n.Emperor entering the country and the capied\namidst acclamations; we have seen him doing all\nthat was possible towards bringing Mexico into a\ncondition to be well governed, and we find in Pre-\nsident Lincoln's recent message that \"the civil\n\"war in Mexico still continues.\" We were full of pity\nfor St. Domingo when the year opened, and so we are\nnow; but the inhabitants have continued their resist-\nance till they seem likely to see the Spaniards sail away\nhomewards as their nesghbours, the Haytians, saw the\nFrench depart on a similar occasion. Spain has com-\nmitted other aggressions in that hemisphere during the\nyear; but they are so sure of their retribution that they\noccasion little anxiety to any but the parties immediately\nconcerned. As for the American conflict, we felt our-\nselves able to wait quietly for the issue. There seemed\nto bean end of solicitations to us to interfere; and the\ndistress in Lancashire was so far mitigated, and the\nprospects of a supply of cotton so far improved, that no\nexcuse was left for any importunity about intervention.\nSuch was the aspect of affairs when the sun rose clear\non New-Year's Day. That brilliant day was made all\nthe brighter to Europe by the pacific tone of the French\nEmperor's oracular utterances to the diplomatic visitors\nat the Tuileries. In a few days the weather grew fear-\nfully cold, inflicting intense suffering on the poor, and\ndeath on the aged and feeble. By degrees, too, clouds\nsettled down on the Imperial mind and countenance;\nand the prospects of Europe were as dark as they have\nbeen for many years. The Prince of August enburg had\nbeen proclaimed at Kiel at the close of the past year;\nno efforts made at Copenhagen to avert a collision were\ntreated with common patience or courtesy; and the\nfirst gunshot of the war between Denmark and the\nGerman Powers was fired on the 31st of January.\nBefore the middle of February Austria had repudiated\nthe treaty by which she had pledged herself to abide;\nand the embarrassment of the situation became extreme\nto the parties to the treaty who were other than Ger-\nmen. In this country the expectation of war was\nvery prevalent\u2014as it Would have been in\nFrance and Russia if the popular interest in\npolities had been anything like what it is with us.\nSince the Ministry were absolved by the critical vote of\nthe Commons on their foreign policy on the Bth of July,\nwe have at I.s:est known what to discuss, and have been\nfree to compare all the ideas which can exist under the\nterm non-intervention.; and thus, by the passing\nalarm of war we may have become better prepared to\nmeet or decline it, on the next critical occasion.\nDuring the months over which the uncertainty ex-\ntended, we witnessed the mournful spectacle of the\ninvasion and dismemberment of Denmark, and the yet\nmore painful manifestation of the worst points of the\nGerman national character. We have seen the consti-\ntutional prospects of Prussia overclouded or destroyed,\nand the dignity of Austria fatally impaired, while the\noutrageous violence of the Minister and the King of\nPrussia carried all before it.\n\nThe Polish insurrection went out with the hanging\n\u2022 of the chiefs of the National Government early in\nAugust; and the vengeance of Russia has had free\ncaurse ever since. The exodus of the Circassians' after\ntheir defence of their country against Russia for so\nmany years, has pained the world's heart\u2014the move-\nment being to the sufferers a concentration of famine\nancipestilence. Tens of thousands of the exiles did not\nwander long, but lay down to die wherever they might\n,be. The Arabs, again, have been showing that they\nare less satisfied or subdued under their rulers at Algiers\nand Tunis than had been supposed; and there has been\nmuch of the scattering warfare which characteripp\n. Northern Africa. We have witnessed the issii\nmore manifesto from Rome against 14.-\nof one\n..a\nknowledge and the development of progress of\nhave felt the effect of the Pope' philosophy, and\n.\nsuppression of the most lib admonition in the\nCatholic organs in this co\" and promising of\nclosing months of the\n- .ntry. And, through the\n.\nbearing of the .I.tal'- ,ear, we have watched the\n-he ope- ians, and especially the Piedmontese,\nundei ation of the Convention of September\n15. The riots at Turin were a melancholy spectacle;\nbut it presently became known that they were a sort of\n\u2022 accident, caused by folly and imprudence, and they\nwere soon forgotten in the nobleness of what followed.\nIn Ametica the aspect of affairs has been not less painful\nas the year has advanced. The war has been prose-\ncuted with unabated vigour, but, notwitbStanding\nrecent successess, with no decisive result. The re-election\nof Mr. Lincoln as President by an overwhelming\nmajority proves that the ,population of the Federal\nStates is still hopeful and resolute in its determination\n\nto reconquer the South. On the other band, the\nConfederates are still unanimously pledged to maintain\nthe independence which they have for more than three\n_ _ _ . . _ _\n\nyears deiended vith a heroin almost unparallelled in\n\nhistory.\nOn the Ist of June the Greek flag was hung out at\nCorfu. We had 3 ielded up the lonian Islands to the\nState to which they desired to belong.; and it was a\nmore blessed day to our country than if it had marked\nthe annexation of new territory. In the middle of July\nthe fii st intimation was made in Canada of the project\nof a Federal Union of our North American provinces,\nwhich has since made such progress as to constitute the\n. . . _\n\n_\nmost important feature of th_ e British policy of the\nyear. In India there has been much good work done,\n' under the rule of Sir John Lawrence, and foremost\namong his good works stands his rescue from death of\nthousands of \u2022 British soldiers and civilians, and of\nnatives, by a stirring bedinning of sanitary reform.\nAmidst serious calamity\u2014such as the hurricane and in-\nundation along the eastern coast, and the apprehended\nfamine from drought, already felt in its beginnings\u2014\nthe prosperity of India has been marvellous, and the\ndevelopment of its wealth beyond all the estimates of\nits rulers. As for the rest, we have made same mis-\ntakes; as, for instance, in the little Ashantee war,\nwhich cost some hundreds of precious lives by bad\n.weather and fever. We have been roughly spoken of\nand unceremoniously used in our Australian colonies;\nbut this happened while conciliatory despatches on the\nconvict question were on the way ; and the altercatten\nmay be considered at an end.\nThe d-tys of Garibaldi's short visit to England in\nApril will stand out in the history of thousands of lives\nas a great festival of the emotions; and the unfortuna.e\nmisunderstanding about the causes of his departure\nwhich spoiled some of the pleasure, and impaired some\u2022\nof the memory it, will, from their nature, be soon for-\ngotten, if they are not already. The day after he dis-\nappeared front the public eye we were celebrating the\nthree huedredth birthcLy of our own greatest man; but\nthe festival was not so well worth remembering as those .\nin which Garib dal was the object of honbur. Though\nearnest and generous efforts were made by individuals\nand groups of ci,izens all over the country\u2014and espe-\ncially at Stratford-on Avon\u2014the 23rd of April was not\na festival day thi oughout toe country, -while it yielded\nso little honour to our Shakespeare that we are probalilv\nall very ready to forget as much of it as we can. The\nWimbledon meeting of Volunteers was the most sue.\n\u2022cessful yet held\u2014a really glorious gathering of the\n.citizen soldiery who have undertaken a large share of\nthe defence of the country; and there wouid have been\nno drawback, but that by an accident a man was bhot.\nThe British Association for the Advancement of\nScience met at Bah in the middle of September,\nWe need not relate how the returned African explorers\nwere the most prominent attraction, nor how eager the\npeers and commoners o; the kingdom of science were to\nhear Capt in Seeke's account of his doings at the sources\nof the Nile; nor whit a dismay fell upon us all when a\nmovemeht of his own gun had silenced him for ever.\nThe Social Science Meeting was a good one for the\ntransa; tion of much useful business, but somewhat dull\nin comparison with tortner years. Tee Agricultural\nmeetings of the autumn were of unusual int4rest, for\ntwo reasons among others. They marked the progress\nof steam tillage, on which the future of the landed\ninterest now largely depends; and they afforded means\n. for consultation among the owners of all kinds of stock '\n\n' about how to feed cattle, horses, and sheep, through the\nwinter and spring\u2014the ordinary resources being cut off\nby the summer succeeding the cold weather of the spring.\nThe harvest, as far as wheat and barley went, was\nadmirable. We need not describe how it was with the\nhay, the pastures, and the roots. We shall feel- the\ntruth long in the price of meat and dairy produce. Then\ncame the autumn storms, and the terrible catalogue of\nwrecks in the great gales in\n.November. Few years\npresent such an array of calamities as has passed before\nthe eyes of residents on our eastern coasts within the\nlast quarter of the year. The accidents of all kinds\nhave indeed been very disastrous\u2014as the bursting of the\nreservoir near Sheffield in March, the railway accidents\nto the Ascot train in June, to the Darlington- train in\nJuly, the collision at Bradford in September, and those\nat Blackheath and Pringbourne ; the-ferryboat accident\nat Glasgow, which destroyed nineteen lives; and the\nfires which have cost us the Savoy Chapel and Haber-\ndashers' Hall, with its antiquarian treasures; besides\nthe Limehouse conflagration, and the explosion in the\nPlumstead Marshes. The horrible railway accident in\nCanada, which destroyed a wholeeompany of emigrants,\nand the cyclone at Calcutta seem to belong to our\nexperience, as they happened within the bounds of our\nempire.\n\nkanufacture and trade have flourished, generally\nspeaking; and every incident which draws attention\nto the fortunes of the working classes shows that those\nclasses understand better and better how to obtain the\nthe full advantage of their earnings. In two years no\nless than two mi lions sterling have been deposited in.\nthe Post-office Savings Bank: the same amount is in-\nvested in co-operative associations; and some of the\nlegislation of last session\u2014as the Government Annuities\nAct\u2014will prove a great help in enabling the labouring\nclasses to become capitalists in their degree, and to\nobtain the same advantages from such money as they\nhave as richer men can command. The increase of\nWorking Men's Clubs, and the Industrial Exhibitions\nwhich have been so prominent in the last few months,\nare influences tending in the same direction. The state\nof the cotton market, through the notion of speculators,\nhas disastrously prolonged the suffering of the Lan-\ncashire operatives, and renewed their hardships on the\napproach of Winter; but they have turned so readily to\nother employments, and their interests have been so\nwell managed, that there can now be no doubt of their\nbeing safely carried through till the fast increasing\nsupply of cotton shall restore them to their old way of\nlife. The strikes of the Staffordshire and the Yorkshire\ncolliers, and the riots at Belfast are the domestic\ngrievances of the year. Those riots happened when the\nlate Viceroy was prostrated by fatal illness. His suc-\ncessor has entered upon office while the shame of the\nBelfast outrages was fresh, and when tte people\nof Ireland were beginning to be cheered by the return\nof good seasons, and a prosperous agricultural year.\nThe most distinct aspect shown by the- government\nand legislation of the country has been its- provisional\ncharacter. The interval has been more or less vigo-\nrously used this year in preparation for sustained enter-\nprise when the time shall come. There are to be\nreforms in the law, and reforms in the representation;\nand the Church is in a state of positive commotion about\nthe schemes over which its parties will struggle and\nstrive. This is one of the marked features of the year\nwhich we are leaving behind. In one of the proposed\nenterprises some progress has been actually made.\nNot only has a Royal Commission reported on our\ngreat public schools, but another Royal Commission\nhas been appointed to consider the whole eubjeet of\nmiddle-class educetion.\nThe Queen and her family have had their ex-\nperiences sweet and bitter, like the rest of us. Three\ngrandchildren have been born to the Queen\u2014our own\nfuture Prince of Wales, one at Berlin, and one at\nDarmstadt. Oar little Prince was born untimely into\ninto a cold-and then troubled world; but the warmth of\nthe national welcome was all the more fervid. His\nDanish mother has had all possible sympathy from the\ncountry generally; and her husband and she were\nfollowed with eager interest in their visits to her parents,\nand to the Royal Family of Sweden. The Queen and\nher children have made more than the usual journeyings\nto Balmoral and Osborne; and it was gratifying to the\nwhole country, as well as to the people of Perth, that\nshe found herself able to attend at the unveiling of the\nstatue-of- the Prince Consort in that city, in August.\nMuch was hoped from this ; audit more has-not followed,\nthere has been some relaxation since last year\u2014some\nfew guests admitted, and somewhat more oP intercourse\nwith the world outside. The Prince and Princess of\nWales have held levees and drawing rooms, and have\npaid ,a memorable visit to Cambridge University, and\nattended reviews, and enjcyed at Sandringham the\ndomestic repose so well earned. While the continental\ndespots have been circling about in Europe, like flies in\nthe air, as if for the purpose of encountering or avoiding\neach other, it was felt everywhere that the Queen of\nEngland could not go to Germany this year. Almost\nall the continental Sovereigns and their Prune-Ministers\nhave met, at various times and places; but Englalid\ndoes not want to enter into their counsele, under the\npresent aspect of affairs;. and the only represene,ative of\nour Royal Family has been Prince Alfred,\nwhere he received the Order of the 'ee at Berlin\neataek Eagle.\nIt has been a year of much sick unusual\n',\nmortality; and this appears in the!le-eag list of deaths of\nand:eeminent as well as common or\n'unknown men. Every-\nbody's first thought will be e\n, oi the two statesmen whom.\nold men little thought\ncastle and the Earl ) survive, the Duke of New-\n'of Carlisle. The Church has lost\ntwo Bishops\u2014 7e\nTurton,. of Ely, and Da.vys of\nPeterboroe `\nJoin The Navy has lost two Admirals\u2014Gage\nand R-\n-1 ,etimarea. Among the peers, two Dukes of Cleve-\naud have died within eight months of each other. The\npeerage of the Earls of Clare has become extinct. The\nDuke of Athole and the Earl of Aberdeen have died in\nmiddle life; and Lord Ashburton before he was old.\nFrom the House of Commons Mr. Spooner will be\nmissed. Among political agitators that too Cervantie\nhero Smith O'Brien must be first, in whatever year he\ndied; but there was also the sound and sensible William\nJohnson-Fox, member for Oldham. The lawyers have\nlost Sir William Atherton, late Attorney-General, and,\nSerjeants Merewethers and Stephen. In philosophy\nand science we feel the loss, not only of our Professor\nFerrier and Leonard Horner, but of the greater Struve,..\nthe Russian, and Sdliman the American. Pere-\nEnfantin, sometime chief of the St. Sineonian brother-\nhood, should rank with ardent workers whose work is-\ndone. With our own, lamented traveller and discoverer,\nCaptain Speke, we may remember Jules Gerard, who.\nhadhis own merits as an African traveller. In litera-\nture we have lost Walter Savage Landor, the poor poet\nClare Alaric Watts, Lucy Aikin, Catherine Sinclair,\nF. E. Smedley, and T. Colley Grattan, Adelaide A.\nProctor and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Colonel Torrens\nand M'Cullooh, busy men in the early days of political\neconomy, have died out in a good old age. George\nDaniel and C. Winston, Mr. Dan, Prof. Pillans, and\nNesseu W. Senior, have also left us during the year.\nOf actors we have lost Frederick Robson, and the\ngallant veteran, T. P. Cooke. In muse, M -yerbeer is\nthe world's loss, in which we share. Poor Behnes, the\nsculptor, in leaving his life of trouble, recalled many\nmemories of old achievements. Of painters, we have\nlost Dyce, and W. H. Hunt, David Roberts, and Lance,\nthe President of the Scottish Academy; Sir John\nWatson Gordon and John Leech.\n\nAUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND JAPAN.\u2014 The\nanti transportation movement is being. energetically\nprosecuted in Australia. The latest advices from New\nZealand mention no event of importance. The natives,\nwho were still in rebellion, were making preparations\nfor a renewal of the struggle. There is nothing of\nimportance from Japan. Sir Rutherford Alcock was\nexpected to return to England by the next mail.\nTim POPE'S ALLOCUTION.\u2014On December 26 the\nPope received the members of the Sacred College and\naadressed to them an Allocution, in which he said that\nin the present day robbery was committed under the\npretext of nationality. The triumph of the Church\nwas certain, the day only of that triumph being un-\ncertain. His holiness added that after witnessing the\ndestruction of the enemies of the Holy See and the\ntriumph of truth and virtue, he would exclaim with\nSimon, \"Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depar t in\npeace.\" All the foreign Amba.sadors, including Baron\nvon Meyendorff, have each had a separate audience of\nthe Pope. The Pope, in receiving the homage, the\ncongratualtions, and sentiments ot devotion presented\nby General de Montebello in the name of the French\narmy of occupation, said :\u2014\" Similar sentiments of the\nFrench army were manifested to me at Gaeta by a\nGeneral who is ow a Marshal, and subsequently by\nall the other Generals who have commanded the French\narmy, and who generously hastened to oefend the\nEternal City. I have always prayed for this army, for\nhim who directs the destinies of France, for his good\nclergy, and for all French Catholics. At the present\ntime I shall not cease to pray for and bless the\nCatholic nation, the Emperor, the Empress, and the\nImperial family, that God may accord them all necessary\nenlightenment.\nLINCOLN CIATIIEDRAL.\u2014WOTIS of restoration at the\nwest front of Lincoln Cathedral are about to be pro-\nceeded with, under the advice of Mr. Buckler, of\nOxford, who has tseen employed for many years by the\nDean and Chapter. What is now being done is to\ncollect the remains of old columns, removed long since,\nand copy them in the minutest deta,l in Lincoln stone,\nthe original material, in order to replace the columns of\nYorkshire grit,\nand at the same time to put in fresh\npieces in those parts of the Norman doorway which are\nperishing from age, these\nParts being also copied with\nthe most minute accuracy. It is a peculiarity of the\nLincoln oolite to become coated with a bard surface\nwhich preserves it, and all that is done at Lincoln is to\nremove the black sooty matter by which this surface is\noverlaid. This is done by first wetting the stone with\nwater from a brush, and then taking off the black wirh\na small tool, without either mallet or hammer, the tool-\nmarks of the old Norman workmen being left. Not\neven this process has been or will be applied to curious\nNorman carvings.\n\nFRIGHTFUL RAILWAY ACCIDENT.\n\nA most dreadful accident, attended with\" loss of life,\noccurred on the night of December 15,. shortly before 8\no'clock, on the Grand Trunk Railroad, about a mile and\na half west of the Detroit and Milwaukee junction,\nthrough a collision between the day- passiuger express\nwest and a freight train going east. The passenger\nI train was behind time and had made all the necessary\npasses, according to the telegraphic instruction, until it\nhad passed New Baltimore \u2022station, where, it is said,\nit had orders to cross the freight going east of the\nDetroit and Milwaukee junction. When it arrived\nthere, according to the story of the operator at the\nGrand Trunk Junction, it had orders' to proceed all\n:right. Under these instructions it passed the\n_junc-\ntion, when shortly afterwards the engineer thought\nhe discovered an engine ahead. The next moment\nhe heard the whistle to down breaks, when he imme-\ndiately gave a similar order and reversed-` his- engine.\nThere were with him in the cab at the time\ntwo other persons besides the fireman. Before they\ncould jump the two engines came crashing together in\nfrightful contact, literally making chaos of everything\nconnected with both. The engines were dovetailed\ninto each other in an inseparable manner, and the snail\nand baggage car of the passenger train driven partially\nthrough the forward passenger car, thereby causing the\nfrightful catastrophe which followed. The passenger\ntrain, which consisted only of two coaches and a bag.gaae car, was crowded-with passengers. Both cars were\nfilled to the utmost, so much so that scarcely even\nstanding room could be obtained. After the accident\nthose in the forward car who were not helplemly\ninjured endeavoured to get out as somas possible. It\nis said, and we give it upon the authority of one of the\npassengers that the baggage man, who, it appears had\ncharge of the train\u2014there being no conductor aboard\u2014\nor one of the breaksmen, shut the hind door of the car,\nand would not for some time allow the passengers egress,\nstating that there- was no danger. Immediately aftet\nthe smash occurred the stoves were up-et and the cars\ntook fire. In an almost incredible spice of time the flames\nenveloped the whole, with the exception of the last car,\nand how many perished time alone can tell. After re-\ncovering from the shock those who escaped turned their\nattentions to the rescue of those in danger, and suc-\nceeded in delivering several from the burning mass.\nWhile thus engagi-d they were forced to witness a sight\nwhich fairly curdled the blood in their veins, and to-\nwards the recital of which the pen denies its office. The\nmail agent,George W. Millen, from Port Huron, was\nfound to be jammed in between the baggage and for-\nward passenger car. His leg wart firmly held between\ntwo pieces of 'broken timber, and all efforts to rescue\nhim before the devouring flames etigulphed him in their\nfolds proved futile. The most herculean efforts to\nextricate his crushed and bleeding limbs were used,\nbut the rapidly spreading flames drove the labourers\nfrom their work, and they were faced to witness, him\nperish before their eyes, his heartrendering shrieks for\nhelp piercing their ears, until stifled amid the smoke\nand flames of the devouring element. God of Heaven, it\nwas a sickening eight, and completely enervated the\nenergies of those around in their duty to others pro-\nbably equally terribly situated. After thefire had burnt\ndown his charred trunk was taken from the-\nruine, the head, arms,. and legs completely devoured,.\nand the body roasted to a cinder. As we.\nhave stated, it is not known how many persons\nperished. We can, therefore, only as yet surmise the.\nnumber sacrificed to the catastrophe. Bome persons in\nworking among the ruins discevered a portion of a\nwomanra hoop skirt, and shortly afterwards-the bones off\na human being among the ashes. Another person drew\nfrom the ruins a portion of the bottom of a' silk dress,\nand a ticket, upon which was the address \"'Miss Mary\nBoorlingham, Oneida, N.. Y.\" But whether this\nbelonged to any one who. perished has not yet bees\ndiscovered.. It is said that a' lady and two children were\nin the oar, who have not turned up, and that a physician\nwho was in the city, awaiting the arrival of a- sister, or\nsome female relative, or both, mourns their absence.\nIt is probable that five on- six- have perished. Beyond\nthe melancholy death of Mr. Millen no other names\nhave transpired. The names-of the wounded, so far as\noould be ascertained, together with the nature of their\ninjuries, areas follows:\u2014Mr. Davidson, express agent,\nDetroit, head and face severely ;.a family named Ashley,.\nfor North Danforth, Massachusetts, consisting of a\nmother, son, and daughter, were more or less- injured.\nThe mother was severely injured about the head and\nface, and the son, it is ftured, is injured internally. He\nwas completely bewildered for some time. The\ndaughter, Mary,. had her arm. broken and- her leg\nseverely bruieed,.and appeared to be suffering intense\npain. They were on their way to Wisconsin, where-\nthey intended to- settle. Mr. Watson, a gentleman\nfrom Canada, internally, so badly as to be unable to\ngive an-account\nhis residence and friend&. A special\ntr.a4.ii left the central depot ,out 10 for the pur-\nPose of removing, the sufferers to the city. Or:jog to\nthe obstructions on the track only those who were acla\nto walk returned by it. Another special, however, was\ndespatched over the southern road to remove those\nwhose injuries- required careful handling. They were\nall brought in at a late hour, and their aufferings as\nkindly administered to as was possible under the cir-\ncumstances. The majority of them are strangers in ea\nstrange land, and should receive the kindest treatment,\nfrom our citizens. It is almost needless-to say that all\ntheir baggage was destroyed, which to several is an..\nirreparable loss. The mails-were also burnt, with the\nexception of slew- letters.\u2014,Detroit Free Russ.\n\nA RURGLA-It\u2022 CAPTURED AT BRIGHTON.\u2014A determined\nlooking fellow, who gave the name of Edward Marriott,\nand his age and residence as \"nowhere\" was charged\nat the Brighton police court, on January 3, with having\nattempted to .commit a burglary at the workshop of Mr.\nBright, a jeweller, in Castle square. In consequence\u2022of\nhaving lost a considerable amount of property twelve\nmonths since, Mr. Bright employed a night watchman\nnamed John Hawkins. About one o'clook a.m. Hawkins\nheard a noise, and secreted himself, Presently he\nobserved a,man pass from the leads of the School ot\nArt, which adjoins, on to the leads-of the workshop.\nThis depredator was followed by a. second, and then\nsomething was handed to them from the roof of the\nSchool of Art by a third accomplice. At this point\nHawkinsse;red the first man with his left hand, and,\npointing a pistol at one of ,the others, threatened to fire\nif he did not surrender. He followed up the threat by\nactually discharging the weapon, and one of the burglars\ncried out, \"I am shot. I'll surrender.\" But instead\nof doing so he and the third man, effected their escape.\nThe men whom Hawkins caught was held by him until\nthe police arrived. He was brought up before the\nmagistrates as stated, and by them remanded.\nTHE BANKRUPTCY OF STRAILLN, PAUL, AND. BATES.\u2014\nThis case has been frequently before the Court of\nBankruptcy, and January 3 was. fixed for a dividend\nmeeting. The total debts proved were \u00a34,46,778, and\na further dividend of 6d. in. the pound was ordered to\nbe paid, making a total of 4s. Bd. There- still remains\nin. hand of the assignee, \u00a33,203, and 414,000 more is\nexpected very shortly from the French. Government,\nupon receipt of which a. further dividend will be\ndeclared.\n\nDEATH OE SIR ALEXANDER BANNERMAN.\u2014InteIIi,\ngence has been received of the decease of Sir A.\nBannerman, Knight, who in 1857 was appointed to the\nchief command of the colony of Newfoundland. The\nancestors of deceased, who was cousin of Sir Alexander\nBannerman, Bart., were hereditary banner bearers of\nthe Kings of Scotland, in the tenth and eleventh\ncenturies. Born in 1783, his earlier years were passed\nin mercantile pursuits, and for some years he was a\nshipowner, merchant, and banker at Aberdeen, of which\ncity he was ultimately elected pi ovost. After the passing\nof the Reform Bill he was elee ad member for Aberdeen,\nwhich he continued to represent without interruption\ntill 1847. In 1837 he was elected Dean of Marischal\nCollege' and in 1851 he was nominated by Earl Grey,\nunder Lord John Russell's administration, to the\nGovernorship of Prince Edward's Island, when he\nreceived the honour of knighthood. He remained three\nyears in his post, which was afterwards exchanged for\nthe Governorship of the Bahamas, and three years sub-\nsequently, he was appointed to the chief command in the\ncolony of Newfoundland.\nROYAL SHOOTING PARTY.\u2014On January 3 their Royal\nHighnesses the Count de Paris, the Duo de Chartres,\nand another member of the ex-Royal family of Orleans,\nvisited Windsor Great Park, for the purpose of enjoying\na day's shooting among the well-stocked coverts and\npreserves of the Royal demesne. Every precaution had\nbeen taxen by the keepers to ensure plenty of game.\nThe Princes reached the Park about 11 o'clock, and were\nmet by Major-General Seymour, the deput3 -ranger, the\nparty being also joined by Lieut.\u2022 Colonel Marsh al, of\nthe 2nd Life Guards. Mr. Cole, the head keeper' as-\nsisted by a number of keepers and beaters, had charge\nof the proceedings, the sport being commenced in the\npreserves near Cumberland Lodge. Thence the Royal\nsportsmen shot over the covert on the right of the road\nleading to Virginia Water, a large number of pheasants\nand rabbits (hares being extremely scarce here) falling\nbefore the guns of the party. The best of the sport,\nhowever, was found in the large covert on the left of\nthe Obelisk drive, which was next explored with the\nmost favourable results. Along this drive the distin-\n\u2022 guished party, with a long line of keepers, advanced\nSlowly along the dry fern, driving the game, which\nevery moment offered first\u2022rate hits, in front of them.\nOne of the Royal game vans followed in the track of\nthe shooting party, whose success by half-past two\no'clock\u2014three hours and a half\u2014mounted up to over\n300 head, double barrelled breech loaders having been\nused by most of the party. Their Royal. Highnesses\nthen proceeded to the Royal fishing temple on the banks\nof Virginia Water, where a splendid luncheon had been\nprovided from Windsor Castle. The lake itself WWI\npat tly frozen, being covered with a thin coating of ice,\nbut not strong enough to bear skaters. After partaking\nof luncheon, the guests took their departure, having\ntifidently enjoyed an excellent day's sport.\n\nMR. GLADSTONE ON COAL RESOURCES\n\nMT. Henry Beckett, F.G.S., of Wolverhampton,\nrecently delivered a lecture in the Assembly Room,\nMold, on \"Geology in its application to the coalfields\nof North Wales.\" Sir S,ephen Glynn\u00b0 presidea. The\nRight. Hon. the Chancalor of the Exchequer was pre-\nsent, and moved a vote of thanks to the lecturer. He\ncongratulated the audience on the justice which Mr.\nBeckett had done to the,aealfield. ot Flintshire, stating\nAbet .he (Mr. Gladstone) was not satisfied with the\ntreatment which that coaifield had received in a variety\nof putilicltions. It had been assumed that because that\nwas an old coal-mini g di\u2022trict\u2014a district where for a\nlong period of time their forefathers:had been scratch-\ning and grubbing, es it were, the surface of the earth\u2014\nthe coals theie were exhausted, and there was no more\noccasion to think about them except just by way of\ngathering up some scraps and leavings which those who\n\u2022came before thent-hail not heen-able to extract from the\nbowels ot mother earth; but he himself had cherished\na hope, which had strengthened\n\u2022from year to year\nand which was now coming to a state of great\nconfidence and vigour, that it might likewise be\nconsidered as a Tory young coal\u2022mining district\u2014that\nit was a district to the real character of which people\nwere only just beginning really to awaken. \u2022 He\nthought the signs baet already appeared that this was a\ntrue conclusion, and he confidently looked for the\nmultiplication of thosa \u2022 signs from year to year. The\ngeneral rule in that district had been in former timas to\nstop at the main coal. It was assumed, for some reason\nor other, that that was the ne plus witra, the very\nfurthestpoint downwards of the coal measures, and the\nworkings in any seams under the main coal had been\nvery insignificant. But when they came to compare\nwhat had taken place in adjoining districts\u2014going, for\nexample down the bend of the Dee to the extreme of\nthe estuary\u2014they found great clusters of coal measures\u2022\ncropping up at different points, and it had never been\nproved yet that the whole of those coal measnr(s\nwere not lying undisturbed and tranquil under\nthe main coal, waiting to be dug up. It .was a\ndistrict in which they might hope that before\nlong deep shafts would be brought into operation.\nThey had now every reason to believe that the\ncoalfield of that district passed under the estuary\nof the Dee and connected itself with the Lancashire\ncoalfield ; and he was sanguine enough to believe that\nthe day was not far distant when the estuary of the\nDee, which now meant a vast surface lying almost\nuseless, would be recovered from the usurpation of the\nsea and brought under cultivation, while the mineral\nenterprise of this great country was at work under-\nneath. Referring to some observations by the lecturer\non the dismal prognostications supposed to have been\nwade by Sir William Armstrong in regard to the\nprobable exhaustion of the coal supply of this country,\nMr. Gladstone said he had been told that in those\nspeculations Sir William Armstrong referred simply to\nthe district within which he spoke. He hoped that\n200 years were not to see the exhaustion of the\nmineral wealth of England, for\u2014having, immense\nconfidence in the resources of this country as well\nas lea the character of the people, which under\nGod was the best of all its resources\u2014he did think that\nthere was nothing certainly which he for one should\ncontemplate with such apprehension as the exhaustion\nof its mineral wealth,. and especially of its supplies of ,\ncoal. He backed Sir William Arnastrong's recom-\nmendation of economy in the use of coal; and he- could\nnot help mentioning that a very intelligent gentleman\nhad informed him that they were cheapening gas at\nsuch a rate that it was-highly probable that after the\nlapse of a few years all houses occupied by the labour-\ning part of the populationin particular would use no\ncoal at all, but would have all the functions of light,\nwarmth, and cooking performed by gas. This opened\nai most unportant source of economy to the working\nclasses,, 'while it also indicated a hope that we\nmight be- permitted to, economise- our stores- of\ncoal, and, at the same time see removed.ithat which was\nlike a great blot on the face of creation\u2014namely, the\nmass of smoke which disfigured large districts of this\ncountry.\n\nAn. inquest'has been held at the Holborn Union, on\nthe body of Annie Hanks, aged seven years. Deceased\ndied from the effects of her dress catching fire on Dec.\n4th,. in consequence of upsetting a penny paraffin lamp..\nA verdict a \"Accidental Death\" was returned.\n\nI WEAVING- BY COMERESBEED, Ain.--A new process of\nweaving by means of compressed air was shown on,\nSiturday to aosumber of scientific gentlemen and manu-\nfacturers, which appears destined to effect a complete\nrevolution in.the textile manufactures a this country.-\nThe loom, which was shown at work near the Swan..\nPier, Loudon bridge, possesses so many advantages over\nany of the existing looms that there can-be little doubt\nt!..e.t it will supersede those now in use-in the manu-\nfacturing districts. When it is stated that there are.\n_upwards of half a million of looms employed in this\nco-,!ntry, some idea may be forme4 or the extent of the\nchange whisk will undoubtedly be effected.

Redditch, and\nhis wife, are in custody upon the charge of seriously\nill-treating two of their children, and thereby causing\nthe death of one of them. Prosser and. his family, ea\nin number, have only resided in that district for a\nfoitnight, having been. engaged by a farmer. The man\nhad four children of his own, and the female prisoner,\nwho is his second wife, bad two other children who\nwera illegitimate. A. Mrs. Ann Thurstans, a neighbour,\nwho had visited the house several times, noticed that\nthe children were not properly cared for, and she had\nalso heard the wcman complain of the trouble they\ncaused her. On Saturday night she was called in to\nsea the child on which the inquest was held, when it\napueared to be very ill. Its stepmother, according to\nthe father's account, had \"given it a little slap or two,\nand it had fallen down.\" Mrs. Thurstans gave informa-\ntion to the man's employer, who communicated with\nthe police, and subsequently two children, boys, were\nremoved to the lodging-house, and placed under medical\ncare, but one of them sank from exhaustion, and died\non Monday morning. When. removed, the children\nwere dreadfully- emaciated, and bore several bruises.\nDeceased's arms and legs were contracted, the ex-\npression of the face .wild and idiotic, the surface of\nthe body covered with dirt, and the hair full of vermin.\nThe opinion of the surgeon, founded upon a post-\nmortem examination of the body, was that death had\nresulted from exhaustion, produced by want of food\nand from cold. The prisoners have been taken\nbefore a [magistrate and remanded. The other boy is\nin such a weak condition that his life is despaired of.\nThe neighbours are !erg indignant at the fact that\nwhile these two children were in such a\nstate of\nsuffering and disease, the two illegitimate children of\nthe woman appear to be strong, hearty, and well fed.\nNmv p\u201e,B.\u2014The Session of Parliament which is\nnow rapidly approaching will see several\nnew faces in\nboth I:louses. The familiar form of the Duke of New-\ncastle has passed away from the House of Lords, and\nhis place will be filled by his eldest son, the Earl of\nLincoln, who in past years was a well known member\nof the House of Commons. The Duke of Cleveland,\nwho enjoyed his honours but a few months, has also\nPassed away, and his seat will be filled by his brother,\nLord Harry Vane, a distinguished member of the Lower\nHouse, who occasionally took a prominent part in its\nproceedings, and who, it *ill be remembered, nominated\nthe present Speaker for his high office.

T. Colmore and.\nA. Dixon at the Erdington Police- court on December 29.\nA \"lady of respectable appearance,\" aged 30, who gave\nher nawe as \" Mrs. Young,\" was charged with stewing\n\u00a3BO, the property of-Maria Holloway. The prosecutrix\nis tie mother of Mrs. Perrins, who is the wife of a\nbrush menufac; urer in Camden street, Birmingham but\nwho res des in the Victoria road, Aston. On Tuelay,\nthe 13th u t., a lady, dressed in black, called at the house\nof Mr. Terries, in the Victoria road. She SAW Mrs.\nPerrino, and stated that she wished to rent a house of\nher. Mrs. Perrins said that she could not go with her\nto show her over it, as shiewas without a servant. The\nlady replis d, \"I know a young person that would just\nsuit you. Sue is an orphan, and when oat of a situation\nlives with me. My name is Mrs. Youn' g and I live in\nAlma street.\" Mrs. Perrins said she would see her, and\nit wasarranged that the \"young person\" should come on\nSaturday morning. On that morning the prisoner, who\nwas the \"young person,\" came and agreed with Mrs.\nPerrins, and she en- ered on her duties on Saturday night.\nThe prisoner said. her name was \"Ann.\" All 'went well\non the Saturday night, and on the next day, Sunday.\nOn Monday morning Mrs. Perrins went out to co lect\nborne rents, leaving the prisoner and three children in\nthe house. So soon as Mrs. Perrins was gone out the\npri,ozier locked the three children ma room, as she sail\nat their mother's desire, and went up-stairs \"to do her\nwork.\" On Mrs. Perrin's return she was going up-\nstairs, when the prisoner told one of the children; to call\nher down, or the baby, who was poorly, would die.\nThis was done, and Mrs. Perrino came down again.\nThe prisoner then said she knew a lady in Philip street\nwho had some very nice goose oil, which she WAS stye\nwould do the chili good, and she would go and fetch;\nsome. She went, but forgot to return. In the mean-\ntime, Mrs. Perrins had gone upstairs, and disovered\nthat \u00a3BO, which beionged to her mother, and which she\nhad left safe in a drawer, was gone. She commuiiic tied\nwith the police, and search was made in Alma st: eat for'\nMrs. Young. The lady in black could not be dis-\ncovered; but a house was found shut up, but in the\npossession of a Mrs. Harvey. The police, having\ngood reason to believe that Mrs. Young and Mrs.\nHarvey were \" closely \" connected, followed up the\ntrack after Mrs. Harvey, and discovered that she was\nresiding in a house at Potter's Hill, Aston. Police\nSuperintendent Bloxham, accompanied by a police con-\nstable and Mrs. Berrins, went there on Monday last.\nMr. Blozham knocked at the door and a female came.\nHe stated who he was, and demanded admittance. The\nfemale replied that she would not open the door, and\nshe drew an extra bolt across it. Access was then\nobtained at a bedroom window. The prisoner was\ncovered in the kitchen sitting before the fire, on wh oh\n20 quantity of paper was smouldering. Only Ss. 10.71,41.\nin money was found in the 15itise, but a receipted bill\nfor \u00a34 Ils, was taken from the prisoner's person. It\nwas also afterwards ascertained that the prisoner had\npaid between LSO and \u00a34O to different tradesmen within\nthe last few days. The same prisoner was then charged\nwith stealing three suits of clothes, value \u00a35, the pro-\nperty of Eliza Partridge, Warwick street, Walsall, on\nthe 15th of May last. The prisoner came on the 12th\nof that month to lodge with the.prosecutrix, and left\non the 17th. On the 18th the goods were misse\nand information given to the police. A descrip-\ntion of the goods was sent round to all the pawn-\nbrokers in the district, but nothing was-heard of them.\nThe prisoner gave the name of Ann to-the prosecutrix,\nand she.being sent for when the prisoner was in custody\non the first charge, recognised her. She then con-\nfessed that two of the suits were at Mr. Smith's, pawn-\nbroker, Potter's hill, and the other suit was Miss Mack's\npawnbroker, Phillip. street. The police found them\nthere. ,The prisoner was committedto the ensuing War-\nwick sessions on both charges. Mr. Dixon said he\ncould not let the opportunity pass without severely\ncensuring the two pawnbrokers mentioned. If they,\nwhen the notices were sent out, had given up the\nclothes the case would have come on then, arid the\nprosecutrix in the first ease would, in all probability,\nhave been saved the etrious loss of a large sum of\nmoney. Since the prisoner's incarceration she has\nconfessed to Superintendent Bloxhara that \"Mrs.\nYoung\" and \"Ann\" were the same person. That\nby the means of false hair and teeth, and different\ndresses, the so disguised herself that when\nshe appeared before Mrs. Perrins as, \"Ann,\"\nand in propria persona, that lady did, not re-\ncognise her. She insists that she did not steal \u00a3BO\nbut \u00a32l. She also states that on one occasion when\nthe police were searching her house for a cash-box sh \u2022\nwas washingAndhadtheaash-box hidden at the bottom of\nthe \"jowl.' On another occasion when, she was wanted\nherself she hid under the- counter of a grocer's shop,\namongst thebacon and cheese. Her history is a most\nremarkable one. At the early age of 19 she was tried\nat Erdington, on the Idth of July, and, after com-\nmitment, was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment.\nIn 1853 she was again sentenced, at Birmingham, to\n10 years' penal servitude. This was afterwards com-\nmuted to eight months. A short time after she again\ncame out of prison she was tried again at Birmingham,\nand sentenced. to four years' penal seruitude,. which\nterm she served at Brixton, returning in 11159. When\nthe came back she got married to a gun-barrel forger,\nand lived with him a short time. Nothing has since\nbeen heard of her until within the last few months. She\nis stated to be wanted in Birmingham on some half-\ndozen charges, and the police have for some time been\non the look-out for her.\u2014Birminghain Post.\n\nLETTER 7Eol`+l THE GEAND DURE NICAOLA.S. - The\nJiroscow Gacctie publishes the following letter addressed\nby the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia to the military\ngovernor of Moscow :\u2014\" Florence, December 10\nMichel Andreievitch,..\u2014Your letter, by which you offer\nboth to me-and' my future wife your congratulations on\nthe occasion of our betrothals, did not reach me until\n.after my departure from Denmark.

Robert Geo. Mime,\nan Independent minister, formerly in charge of a con-\ngregation at Tintwistle, but now residing at South-\nport, sued the London and North-Western Railway\nCompany for damages. in consequende of a railway\naccident. The case was a very peculiar one. The\naccident took place at Copley Hill, Leeds, so far back\nas Oct. 16, 1867, but it was not till November, 1868,\nthat plaintiff was permanently. disabled. in the\nmeantime he had been engaged ,as local secretary of\nthe British and Foreign Bible Society .at a salary of\n\u00a33OO per year, and travelled about the country, de-\nlivering addresses on its behalf. On November 12,\n1868, thirteen months after the accident,'he \"had, a\nparalytic attack which rendered him so complete a\nwreck that his evidence had to be taken by commis-\nsion. The question in dispute - was whether the\nparalysis resulted from the accident. The defendants\ncontended that it was too remote from the time of the\ncollision to have been caused by it, and the fact that\nthe plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel\nabout the country and deliver addresses, night after\nnight, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible\nBociety, was relied on in proof of this. On the other\nside it was maintained that from the time of the acci-\ndent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the\nfinal seizure, and that there was a continuity of\nSymptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were\ncalled on each side who directly contradicted each\nother as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The\njudge, in summing up, said the plaintiff was clearly\nentitled to damages for the sufferings he had under-\ngone since the time of the accident, but he could give\nno assistance as to the real point at issue. After a\nconsultation of twenty minutes, the jury returned a\nverdict for the plaintiff\u2014Damages \u00a32,000.\n","403068":"THE EXPLOSION AT CHILWORTH.\n\nOn the 6th of August an. inquest on the tolies of\nJohn Farnfield and Charles Mansell, the unfortunate\nmen who were killed by the late explosion, was opened '\nby Mr. C.

The room in which\nthe inquiry was conducted, and which was situate atout\na quarter of a mile from the powder mills, was a long\napartment, furnished with numerous windows, all of\nwhich had been demolished by the explosion. The\nCoroner said that in this inquiry it would be neces-\nsary to ascertain not merely the cluse of death, but\nalso whether the machinery employed at the powder\nmills was proper for the particular manufacture,\nand, whether due precautions were taken for the\nprevention of accidents: His pra sent intention was\nmerely to open the inqulry and then adjourn it.

They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found.

The\nvalue of the minerals produced was \u00a329,151,976, from\nwhich metals of the value of \u00a336,364,327 were extracted.\nOf gold quartz we produced 385 tons, worth \u00a31,500; of\ntin ore, 15,157 tons, worth \u00a3963,985; of copper ore,\n212,947 tons, worth t,100,554; of lead ore, 91,283\ntons, worth \u00a31,193,530 ; of silver ore, 38 ton., worth\n\u00a35,703; and of zinc ore, 1,941 tons, worth \u00a329,968.\nDuring the year in question there were sold 95,376\ntons of pyrites, for \u00a362,035; and the rarer mimnils\u2014\nwolfram, uranium, gossans,\nof\nn.c, and earthy minera's\nraised were of the value ot \u00a31,980,866. Th se items, i\nwith the value of 9,101,552 tons of ron ore, \u00a33,240,890,\nand 86,292 215 tons of coal, \u00a320,572,945, raises the\ntotal to \u00a329,151,976, which was manufactured into\nnearly \u00a340,000,000 of merchantable produce. To pro-\nduce these results direct employment has been given to\nat least 500,000 men, so that our mineral industries may\nbe considered as alone supportipg a population of nearly\n3,000,000, in addition to adding !much to the general\nwealth of the kingdom, and especially to the wealth of\nthose whose capital has been employed in mining ope-\nrations.\u2014Afinirq Journal.\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO A CHILD AT A RAILWAY STA-\nTION.--A frightful accident has occurred to Frederick\nPacker, a boy 11 years of age, at the New-cross station\nof the Brighton Railway. It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally. This com-\npany paid \u00a38,351 as compsnsation for personal injui\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BATH.\u2014The Queen has been\ngraciously pleased to give orders for the following\nappointments to the Most Honounble Order of the\nBath.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep. These\npowders were to be tatters in preserves' and on Tuesday\nmorning, the nurse having prrpared one for Mrs.\nRawlin, in order to give it to her as soon as she awoke\n(she was then sleeping with the child by her side)' left\n, the room. On her rcturn, Mrs. Rawlin told her that\nthe child had been out of bed and eaten \"the goody.\"\nHe was then snoring loudly, and although she tried to\nrouse him she could not, and he shortly afterwards died.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death.\"\u2014\nWeeeli:ld Journal.\nTHE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT MONT-\nGOLFIER BALLOON. Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching. They consist of 4 iron screw ships,\n2 iron-cased screw ships, 1 screw iron corvetts, I double\nscrew iron gim boat, 1 uouble screw iron and wood gun\nboat, 6 screw frigates, 3 screw ships, 2 screw corvettes,\n4 screw sloops, 1 paddle dispatch vessel, 5 screw gun\nvessels, and 6 screw gun boats.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife. If Johnson's wife had lived there\nwould have been no hoarding up of bits of orange-peel;\nno touching all the, posts in walking along the street;\nno eating and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If\nOliver Goldsmith had been married he would never\nhave worn that memorable and ridiculous coat. When-\never you find a man whom you know little about oddly\ndressed, or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any\neccentricity of manner, you may be tolerably sure that\nhe is not a married man. For the little corners are\nrounded off, the little shoots ate pruned away, in\nmarried men. Wives generally have much more sense\nthan their husbands, especially when the husbands are\nclever men.

JOUN KETTLE EXLMIItED.\nChairman: They gave the name of the author,\nwithdrew the imputations, expressed their regret,\nand paid the cost I suppose P\u2014They paid the costs\nof my solicitor. The writer said that I had under-\nmined my fellow-man or something to that effect, ,\nand it was the reverse. There was an article that\nappeared in the Spectator on the 21st of January\n1865, I think, and this which I hold in my hand is\nan article that was written as an answer to that;\nit was written by Mr. Little, Mr, Bra mall's\nmanager; it was for Mr. Braraall to send to the\nSpectator contradicting their article, but Mr.\nBram 1 was taken ill, and it never was printed,\nandkMr. Little wished me to leave this before the\nCommissioners just as it is.\nEarl of Lichfield: The statement made in the\nSpectator never has been answered P\u2014No, this is the\nanswer partly written.\nIt was not furnished in consequence of Mr. ,\nBramall's illness ?\u2014Just so; he has been dead two'\nyears in March.\nManchester is the centre of one of the largest 11\nsocieties of bricklayers, is it not P\u2014lt was previous\nto this time last year.\nWas it the centre of a large society at the time\nthat the strike took place through their demanding\nto have you dismissed P\u2014Yes, it was the head lodge;\nthe executive council, that is what it is called.\nThen the funds expended were collected I sup-\npose from the different districts ?\u2014lt was a local\nstrike ; it was not a general strike.\nPerhaps you cannot give any information on that\nsubject ?\u2014Yes, I can.\nDo you know how the funds were obtained P\u2014The\nfunds were obtained from the general fund, after ,\ntheir own lodge funds were exhausted they borrowedl\nmoney from the general fund; having the treasurer '\nand secretary and all in their own district. They\nmade use of that until they had \u00a3920 I believe from\nthe general fund. In consequence cf that I pub-\nlished a pamphlet, showing to the branch lodges\nhow the executive conducted the business, and that\nthe bricklayers published a report every month, and\npublished in that repeet a warning to all lodges\nagainst taking any members that have been work-\non the gaol.\nDo you see their report ?\u2014I have not seen that\nnumber.\nHow doyou know that then P\u2014l have been told\nby Manchester members and Bolton members, and\nby the president of the Barrow lodge. It can be\nproduced.\nIR what shape does it come out fe\u2014lt c a cut\nin a notice-, there is one leaf for netices.\nHow often P\u2014Every month. In that notice it\nwarns all lodges against taking any members that\nhave been working on the gaol at Manchester.\nDoes it at the same time eve the reasotes for\ngiving that notice ?\u2014The whole reasons have been\nprinted before warning the members not to came to\nthe place.\nDo you knew what statement was made at that\ntime in this circular P\u2014Not exactly.\nDo you know to what effect it was at all The\neffect was that there was a strike at the gaol eon-\neequenee of my putting a labeurer to carry first (it\nwas a true ,statement that was in, I believe), and\nthat the tricklayers had *taken sides with the\nktbourers, and did not wish any bricklayert\u2022to come\nuntil the die,pute was settle.\nI suppoee upon that the funds were obtained from\nthe diterert districts P\u2014No, district lodges have not '\npaid any ,coatribution towards that any further'\nthan what :has come out of the general 'fznd.\nWhat do you call \" the genera.l fund P,'!\n\u2014All enembers belonging to the 'bricklayers'i\nassociation are supposedle pay 4d. a week.

The strike had been !prolonged\nabout two atad.athalf years. Threugh my printing,\na pamphlet and showing them how they,eanducted\ntheir business on the executive council, there was a\ndelegate meeting .called, and when this delegate\nmeeting was called they were asked a queation on\nthe subject. I had-stated that they had ovec \u00a3BOO\nfrom the general fund, and when they were asked\nthe question wheater they had had that muck from\nthe general fnnd they had to acknowledge that they\nhad \u00a3920 for the Furosesof this strike, and that\nthe country lodges did not know that they had had\na penny at the time.\nThe other district iedges did not agree to give any\nsupport to the Manchester lodge ii this strike\u2014\nThey never were asked.\nAnd the executive being in Manchester borrowed\nfrom the funds of the other districts money to meet\nthis Manchester ledge strike P\u2014The Manchester\nLodge Committee 'aorrowed it from the executive\ncouncil without the sanction of the .her branches\n\u2014they did not ask the other branches for the loan\nsf it.\nChairman: Did not the other branches sanction\nit in the end ?\u2014They did at this delegate meeting,\nwhen the questioa was brought on about the\nexpenses, about their owing this money. The\nquestion was whetherthey would make the Man-\nchester lodge pay tlis \u00a3920, for the Manchester\nlodge made a claim of that, because they made it\nout that I had fetched London society men into\nManchester in crder to import another branch\u2014that\nis to say, to \u00b0pee another lodge in Manchester. On\nthat account they claimed it as a general strike, as\na legal strike. The delegates who were collected\ntogether decided that they would sanction the\nManchester lodge being made a present of this \u00a3920\nfor the purposes of the strike by the executive\ncouncil.\nBecause some delegates from London had been\nbrought down they approved of it. A delegate\nmeeting of the whole body voted that that money\nshould be sanctioned P\u2014Becanse I had fetched men\nfrom Leamington belonging to the London society\nthey made it appear as if I had wished to introduce\na fresh society into the town of Manchester.\nThat is the reason why the suffrages of all the\nmembers were in favour of paving that \u00a3920 ?\nYes, the London society and the Manchester society\nwere at variance at that time, they would not work\none 'with the other, and through my fetching the\nLoudon society men to this job they sent Edward\nCoulson from London down to Manchester to fetch\nthese men off. The two societies agreed at that\ntime. He came down specially for that purpose.\nSir D. Gooch: Is that the Mr. Coulson who has\ngiven evidence here ?\u2014Yes.\nEarl of Lichfield: Did they assign any other\nreason for striking besides the one you have referred\nto, in consequence of your appointing a certain man\nleader of a gang ?\u2014No, it was all for putting this\nleader to carry first that they struck, that was the\nsole reason; they could not prove anything that\never I had done amiss to the society, or that I had\nworked against the rules, and I have been 19 years\na member on the 2nd of June,\n\nOf that society P\u2014Of that tiociety. No one can\nwork in Manchester unless he does belong to it. As\nsoon as a man gets a job his card is demanded, and\nif he has not a card he must knock off.\n\nWhen did you cease to be a member of this\nsociety P\u2014l owed six weeks' Icontributions when\nthey shelved me, and I have rkever paid anything\nsince.\n\nSir D. Gooch: What. do yoii. call \"shelving ?\"\n7-Trying to force one off the job, that is what they\n\nterm \"shelving.\"\nMr. Harrison: Did you atm\nthe lodges whilst ---\nYes.\n\nHave you ever been present when anything like\na case of trade outrage has been brought 'before the\nnotice of the lodge in any way P\u2014 -tioned by\nthe society of bricklayers. I nel. .e brick-\nlayers to sanction any assault ,in Itl was\nconnected with them, but some members\nthat have been on their own account have committed.\nan assault. In the case of Archibald Neale job,\nat Oldham, there was a man who went over there\nand Mused the men, I believe.\n\nDid the society or the executive take any steps\nupon that ?--No, not to pay money or anything,\nthey did not approve of it.\nDid they show disapproval of it in any way ?\nYes, the bricklayers never did approve of it.\nYou have never known any case of outrage or\nviolence which has been sanctiond by any lodge or\nby the executive P\u2014Not by the bricklayers.\nEarl of Lichfield: In what way did they signify\ntheir disapproval P\u2014The way it is generally done is\nto stop the bricks or to work with the other trades\nand stop the joiners for instance. If they could\nnot do it themselves they would prevail on another\ntrade to come out.\nMy question is this: in what way did they sig-\nnify their disapproval of this outrage that you say\nwas perpetrated by one of their members ?\u2014They\ntold him that that they did not agree with anything\nof the sort.\nSir D. Gooch : They did not fine him for that ?\n\u2014No, they never inflicted any sort of fine, but they\ndid not approve of it they said.\nMr. Harrison: You were speaking just now of\nwhat they did towards employers with whom they\nhad a difficulty, but with respect to the intimidation\nof members, have you ever known of any case of\noutrage (or \" rattening \" as they call it at Sheffield)\nhaving been sanctioned by a lodge or by an officer\nagainst a defaulting member P\u2014No.\nMr. Booth: But those pickets that you have told\nus interfered with the non-union men whom you\nwere employing were appointed, I suppose, by union\nbricklayers P\u2014They were appointed by union brick-\nlayers.\nAnd, in some instances at least, they used a\ncertain degree of violence towards your men, did\nthey not P\u2014l never knew any violence used, except\nin this way, to the bricklayers working on it. It\nwas done by the labourers; they waylaid the men\nas they were going home alongside the railway\nstation. Some \u2022of the labourers were armed with\nsoda-water bottles, and one had an iron bar, and\nsome of the others had sticks.\nThen those labourers were not employed by the\nunion in any way F\u2014They were union men; the\ndelegate was one of them that walked about.\nButdid the union, as far as you know, express\nany disapproval of that proceeding ?\u2014I was not in\nconnexion with them then.\nYou do not know therefore ?\u2014No.\n\nSir D. Gooch: Do these men keep a delegate, a\nsort of police officer, walking about ?\u2014Yes, each\nsociety.\nWhat do these clelates do hey go round to\nthe different jobs, Iliad if there is a man working\nwhom they do not know, or that they think behind\nwith his contributions, they .ask him for his card,\n.and if he has not a card he has to pay so much\nmoney, generally Ss. (the 'entrance fee is \u00a3l, and\nthey generally give them a month to pay their \u201eV\nin), and if he does not pay they withdraw the other\n,en.\nThat class of Taal' is paid, I presume, by the\n-sieiety ?\u2014Yes.\nHe is an idle inan, he does not work 9\u2014He is a\nman that does PA work at all. How long does his\nposition last ?\u2014The last one that was On was\nMichael Coney, and to my knowledge he has been\non for nine years. I think that the roson wky\nthey kept him ,on so long was that he .was a erip,ple,\nand. his fingers were run up together. Still thu\npaid him the >same money as .any of the men :kept\non work.\n\nWhat do they pay this imam ?\u2014He moceives 36g\u2022\na week now.; the wages are advanced 3s. a week\nin Manchester :new.\n\nHe is paid. pretty much the same as-the meu.?\n\u2014Exactly the-seine.\nIf they get Lid of an inspector of that kind does\nhe return to the trade 9\u2014Yes, he would have, o do\nso. This one wits on the accident fundrand received\nOs. a week when disabled, .and if struck off from\ndelegate work he would have to.go back to that.\nIs it the practice to keep these men on, \u2018er is this\nau exceptional case ?\u2014Yes, it is .exceptiontl.\nHow long do they usually remain on P\u2014They\n,pro-\nfess to elect their officers for three months, after\nthat they elect another.\nEarl of Lichfield: You talk .about a ,committee\nhaving been established in the :next house to you.;\nwas that a committee of the bricklayers' seciety or\nof the labourers' society P\u2014Thy were mixed all to-\ngether. It was furnished .by the brickla\u201eyers ; it\nwas furnished by this .James Powers, the toeasurer\n,for the bricklayers' cociety \u2022 they took the room from\nthe woman who scoupied the next house and fur-\nitished it.\n\nThat was done 'by the bricklayers' society:?\u2014Yes.\nMat was done by the 'bricklayers' society.\nDid not you say that .at one of Sheir meetings ,a\nparson was there who was accused of having taken\npart in the outrage you have referred to, and .also\n:another person, a witn.ec-,3 ?\u2014Yes, Jan Nolan. He\nwas tried at the sessions for the assautlt on Wilfred,\nand Carr, the principal witness that swore to ,him\nwas drinking with him in the same hause about two\ndays after he got his release.\nThen you say that the .committee of the brick,\nlayers' society and the committee of the labourers'\nsociety were acting together in this house next door\nto you ?\u2014Yes, the joiners and all.\nThey had all combined F\u2014Through wiling the\njoiners out of the assize ,eoults they had all com-\nbined together, and when I had to come home to\nmy meals from work I had to pats througk perhaps\na score ,of them.\nThis house was taken for them cli to meet in ?\nYes. For them all to meet in.\n\nOf ,course each society had its own proper Qffices\nas well .P\u2014Yes.\n\nBut upon this occasion they took the house next\nto you in order that they might all meet there r\nYes. Them was a beerhouse at the corner ; the\nlandlord acted as the agent for this property, and\nthey got the landlord to get a house for them. He\nwent to the next door but one on the opposite side,\nwhere they took the hoe and asked a woman if\nshe could spare any rooms. She said that she had\nnone to spare, but that he might find a house in\nanother row. He said, \"It will not do in another\nrow, it must be under the same roof.\" But when\nthey could not do any harm or intimidate ma to leave\nthe job, they got the landlord to give me notice to\nleave, because otherwise some of his houses would be\nset on fire.\n\nWho was the landlord ?\u2014His name is Miller; he\nkeeps an eating house in Market-street; he was\nformerly in the marble trade.\nDo you say that he had notice that if you were\nnot turned out of the house the house would be set\non fire ?\u2014This landlord at the earner said, or he got\ntwo or three of the neighbours to sign a paper to\nsay, that their houses were in danger of being set\non fire by the society men, on account of my being\nallowed to live there.\n\nWho got that done ?\u2014Beard, the beerhouse\nkeeper, did it.\nMr. Verivale : Do you mean that Beard was in\nthe interest of this union society ?\u2014He acted in\ntheir interest on account of having men to drink at\nhis house.\n\nHe is not a member of that ociety P\u2014Not that I\nknow of; he might be of the ;oiners ; he is P. joiner\nby trade..\nEarl of Lichfield: At any I ate, do you speak\npositively with regard to that, that the landlord re-\nceived that notice P\u2014We had it from the parties\nwhom he wanted to sign the pap_r.\nMr. Merivale : Who told you tl.is ?\u2014One of the\ntenants.\n\nWas he a man that Beard came to P\u2014Yes.\nBeard not being the landlord himself ?\u2014No, the\nagent._\n\n-Earl of Lichfield : Did you leave ?\u2014Yes.\nDid not you remonstrate with hi tt ?\u2014lt was not\nto me he gave it, but my wife. I went and got\nanother house, and one of the club men followed the\ncart to see where the cart was going to when we left\nthe house.\n\nDid they establish any offices next door to you\nthere P\u2014No, they never took any step there, but\nthey followed the cart to see where I went to.\nChairman: Did you know the landlord of the new\nas he a chance man that had a house to\n' you know him ?\u2014I went round, 4nd a\nme that there were some houses to let\n\nthere. We went and inquired who was the land-\nlord, and they told us the landlady, and she let me\nthe house without any words.\nDid she know the circumstance F\u2014l told her.\nThey have not made any attacks on women yet as\nfar as we have heard P\u2014No, they have never taken\nany step excepting that.\nMr. Harrison : You de not consider yourself in\ndanger of any other kind of.interference, I suppose?\n\u2014Of course they never allow any man to work for\nus, not yet. About a month or six weeks ago this\noccurred. Mrs. Bramall had two houses to build at\nMoss Side, and she sent to Mr. Worthington, the\ncontractor (he is a brickmaker as well) to know if\nhe would supply bricks for those two houses, and he\nsent word that he could not. I went on Higgins's\nwork (he is a master brickmaker) and I asked his\nbrickmakers whether it was an order from them or I\nwhether Worthington was takinc, the step on his\nown responsibility, and they said they had served\na circular from their society to every master brick-\nmaker not to allow Mrs. Braman to have any bricks.\nShe has to give up the whole of her trade, except\nthe gaol.\nChairman: Ts there any particular kind of land\nwhere brick earth is to be found that limits the ,\nbrickmaking in Manchester' or is the whole of the\ncounty brick land; is it in fact brick clay all over\nthe county P\u2014On the west side of Manchester there\nis not much clay. It is chiefly on the north and\neast sides.\nEarl of Lichfield: What district do you call\nthat ?\u2014Ashton Road district, and Hyde Road and\nStockport Road. When we get up to Stetford on\nthe Cheshire side, there is not muck clay. The\nstrongest clay is on Hyde Road and Stockport Road.\nWhen did you say Mr. Braman died P\u2014About\ntwo years last March.\nThat was after this dispute took place P\u2014Yes, he\ndied the March after the occurrence. The occur-\nrence was on the 11th of April, and he died the\nMarch after.\nHe stood by you throughout P\u2014He stood by me\nthroughout. I was asked by Mr. -Waterhouse to\nget another job through the annoyance that the\nclub men caused to him.\nDo you think that there are many men in your\nexperience who would have stood out against the\ndictation ef the unions in that manner, and kept\nyou in their employ P\u2014l would not have Come if\nthey had not stuck by me, because I had a good\nsituation where I was.\n\nYou were sure that he would stand by you ?-11e\nsaid he would stand by me as long as I did my duty,\nand cf course I tried to do my duty on both sides.\nlie .guaranteed to stand by me as long as I did my\nduty, and of course he did so.\nAnd you feel confident that they never assigned\nany other grievance against you except that you\ndismissed this foreman you have referred to F\u2014That\nwas the only plea that they had, because I put this\nlabourer to go first, and he was the last that came.\nYou are sure that they never assigned any other\nreason 9\u2014They never assigned any other reason in\npoint, nor said anything else, except the man whose\nwork cost 4s. pec yard for nine-inch work.\n\nMr. Merivalc Who was it that this society used\nto send to talk to yon\u2014the delegate P\u2014A delegate\ncame to say *at these men must take their former\nplace. They never came there, but we carried on\nthe job; as aong as they would not come to us we\nwould not go to them, we got the men as best we\ncould. We wo id not make any concessions.\nEarl of Lichfield: You are still employed on the\nsame work T\u2014Yes.\n\nHave any union men come P\u2014Some.edd ones, only\ndefaulting men, wile have not paid their arrears.\nThey are mostly non-society men that you em- I\nploy P\u2014Yes., and msehine-made brieht,\n--Is it at the rate laid tdown by the nuion that the\nmen are paid by ycu, or according to efficiency?\u2014\nWe guarantee allihemen that cometonthat job Man-\nchester wages and.pri\u2022vileges. We have never taken\nany advantage of them, and when hare found men\nthat have .been above Ttfle average, I have given them\n6d. a dav,extra above Manchester wages.\n\nHave you. never paid less P\u2014To one or two that\nhave been inferior, not,competent to take his place\nwith the other men, but: not to any one that is a fair\naverage 'bricklayer.\nHave you done so in any other trade, the joinere,\nor any \u2022other trade connected with the job P\u2014To\nfurnish the assize\u2022courtE we had to rais3 the jo nevi'\nwages, which were 28s. to 345., and to give thearra\nguarantee of ..-C2 if they stop on the job till the\nassize courtE were finished. -\n\nHave you paid them all the same 'wages ?\u2014We\nhave paid th\u2022em all Manchester wages since. That\nwas a special understanding. There huve been two\n;advances with the joiners and two advances with\nhe bricklayers, and when the Manchester men have\nadvanced we have advanf;ed too.\n\nWhen a man is not worth the average ,wages, you\n:discharge him, jsuppose.F\u2014ln some caees we have\n;paid him what he is worth.\n. Something below thetregular rate P\u2014Yes, what he\n;is worth in yroportiontothe other.\nMr. Harriso\u00df.: What .number of those:eases have\nyou P\u2014Only one, I;thiuk, mow.\nMr. Hughes:: Why did you say that yzu would\nguarantee the joe.ners.\u00a32 P\u2014Because we had :to finish\ntheteourts by the 1.26 th of luly, and at that time\nthere were no joieers on t all; we had to he put\nto that expense, kf s. .a week :extra, and \u00a32 to induce\nth\u2018tm .to stop till that time. That was tctr,ptation\nto them so that tie 'society imen F.hould not draw\nthem off.\n\nWas it a bonus GC P\u2014A ibonus of -02 the\nJump., besides 6s. a week extra.\nMr. Rarrison : You were doing precisely win. the\nunion was doing, they were bribing the men te ztay\naway and you bribed them to come ?\u2014Yes Ave\ncould tr, ot get men on the job\nEarl of Lichfield: In short, you (could not get 4-ze\neontract completed without this .additional bonu of\n.a.?\u2014Yes, that was to ktop the delegate from\nget-\nting .at them an enticing them off tize work, it was I,\ndone because we thought that they would not leave\nthose two pounds, but would stop at the work.\nMr, Hughes.: You gave these very high wages in:\nconsequence of the action of the union P\u2014We were\nobliged to do so.\nBut for the union you would not have given these\nhigh wages P\u2014No, we said that they should have\nthe same privileges.\nThis instance, of course, was a special case in\nwhich the action of the union forced you to give\nhigher wages; but do you think that in general the\naction of the Union keeps up wages ?\u2014Yes, it cer-\ntainly does, because when I went to Barrow-in-\nFurness there was no society there, and they\nestablished a society there and about twelve months\nafter the society was established they got up from\n4s. to ss. 94. per day.\nDo you think that that is to the advantage of the\nmen ?\u2014lt certainly is an advantage to a trade when\none trade has more than another, but it is not an\nadvantage to that trade when they all get up alike.\nDo you that on the whole the unions are an\nadvantage or a disadvantage to the men ?\u2014They\nare of most advantage to the inferior class of work-\n\nBut on the whole do you think that it would be\nfor the benefit of the men that the unions should be\nabolished P\u2014l think-it would be a benefit to the bese\nof the workmen.\nEarl _of Liebfield : Would it be a benefit to the\nmajority or to the minority ?\u2014The minority are the\nbest of the workmen.\n- -\n\nMr. Hughes: Therefore the abolition would\nbenefit the minority ?\u2014Perhaps one man about in\n-every ten would be above the average. If a master\nbricklayer was to give that man an extra 6d. the\nother men would make it out that he had given him\nthat extra 6d. to favour him, and then they would\ncome and demand it. There are plenty of cases in\nManchester in which some bricklayers are worth is.\na day more than the others.\nDo you think that if the unions were abolished\nfor the majority of men, the inferior workmen, the\nwages would fall P\u2014l certainly do think that if\ntrade societies were abolished they would fall, it is\nthe societies that have kept the wages up, although\ngood trade would raise wages at any time when\nthere is a scarcity of hands.\nBut do you think that the rise would come very\nquickly in that case ?It would not come so quickly\nas it does with the unions, because when one master\nhas to give more money to get men, the rest of the\nsociety men make a claim and of course they hav& a\nsociety at their back and they can do it better than\nindividual men can.\nYou do not think tlkat if the men were left to\nmake their, bargains as individuals with their\nmasters they, would get such high wages or so quick\na rise ?\u2014The best of the men would get the rise.\n_ _ _ .\n\nWe are speaking now of the majority P\u2014l do not\n\nthink they would get it so quick as with the society\nat their back.\nI think since Mr. Brarnall's death the busitreas\nhas heen carried on by his widow ?\u2014Yes, she is his\nsole executrix.\n\nAnd the unions have gone on to annoy her in the\nsame way as they annoyed him during his lifetime?\n\u2014The annoyance was all over before Mr. Bramalt\ndied.\nBut they interfere with her carrying on any other\nwork ?\u2014Ys, she had to give up all other trade, and\nMr. Bramall had also when he took the gaol on\naccount of using machine bricks.\nAnd that ban is still upon his window 9\u2014Yes, she\nhave neither joiners, bricklayers, nor hand-made\nbricks from club labour. The masons and plasterers\nnever had anything to do with it, nor subscribed that\nI know of. . .\n\n_\nChairman: What is the difference of cost in\nmachine-made brickwork as compared with the\nother ? Can you state what it is in a rod of nine-\ninch brickwork and that would give us a ratio ?\nThe shedule price orlour work is 2s. 3d. per yard,\nnine-inch work, and if it were hand-made bricks it\nwould be about 2s. 10d., then we should have to give\n19s. a 1,000 for them. The guarantee to\nBratnall was that the price of his bricks was 11\nper 1,000, and if he had had hand-made bricks the\nprice would be 19s, per 1,000, that is about 7d. dif-\nference in the yard of nine-inch brickwork.\nMr. Hughes: Do you think machine bricks much\nbetter than hand-made bricks 9\u2014There are some\nsorts of them that are very good. Platt's machine\nbricks are very good square bricks; they can lay\nthem a good deal better. We have used 8,000,000\nof Platt's bricks.\n\nYou think the extra pressure, perhaps, very ad-\nvantageous-40 tons on every brick one witness told\nus P\u2014Some say about 70.\nWhatever it is it must be very valuable P\u2014Yes.\nWe are building a chimney now, 226 feet high,\nwith about 1,003,000 of bricks in it, and fc.cin g it\nwith these pressed bricks of Platt's.\nMr. Roebuck: They are much harder than others,\nare they not P\u2014Yes.\nDid you ever hear of bricklayers making any\nobjection to use them because they were harder ?\nThey will not use them at all in Manchester. There\nis another matter I should like to refer to. The last\nwitness that came up spoke with regard to Thomas\nBarlow, who had to do with that murder of Jump,\nat Ashton. Barlow confessed, and just after the trial\nI had Barlow come to work on the same job where\nI was. About a dozen of the ;brickmakers belong-\ning to the Manchester society (I know one or two of\nthem by sight) came up to the job and wanted to\nknow if he were working there. I said he was, but\nwas not there that day, and they took and searched\neverywhere about the place to find Barlow. They\neven went in the office that I had put plans in, and\nlooked in the fire-place, and went to see if he had\nrun out into the road.\n\nDid you take no steps to punish those men for that\nact ?\u2014I was only foreman, just as I am now.\nDid your master take any steps P\u2014No.\nDid you complain to him P\u2014l told him that they\ncame up, but my idea was that they wanted to stop\nthe bricks.\n\nHad you any idea that it was an illegal proceed-\ning on their part P\u2014Of course I knew that it was\nillegal; I knew that they had ii. business to ooze\nand threaten anyone at the job.\n\nWho was your master then P\u2014Mr. Warburton.\nHe took no steps to punish them P\u2014No, he durst\nnot; if he did he must close all his other jobs.\nWe are to conclude then that he was under\ncoercion and error such as to compel him to allow\nan illegal offence to be committed without seeking\nto punish it P\u2014Yes ; if he had punished it they\nwould have stopped all his works.\nEarl of Lichfield : Was Barlow in any way con-\nnected with the management of any of these\nsocieties F--1 do not know; Barlow was a stranger\nto me altogether.\nMr. Roebuck: You know nothing of tra des'\nunions.?\u2014res, I was 19 years in one.\n\n(To be ,ocatinued.)\n\nTENDERS.\n\nFor girls' school and muter'a holm Tt 'Silva' Town, north\nWool ich.

Two hundred men were hard at\nwork when one of them struck into a fissure and in a\nmoment a strong current of gas burst forth that in an\nincredible space of time completely checked the ventila-\ntion. The men dew for their lives; one lame man\nnarrowly escaped suffocation, as he was not able to\nkeep pace with the rest. Happily no one was injured,\nand measures were at once taken to clear the workings\nof gas and restore the ventilation, Had this 'blower,'\nnot been discovered at the moment, or had there. been\none damaged lamp, all, or nearly all, of these two\nhundred men would have been sacrificed.

I am perfectly con-\nvinced that the only way of effecting a peaceful\nchange in the laws relating to land in this country\nin our onward march to the ultimate good of making\nthe land national property must be through a\ntransition state. I would say in regard to the land\nlaws precisely the same as Mr. Fox says in his in-\ntroductory letter on currency reform, in alluding to\nthe adoption of a system of equitable exchanges,\n\"that the ultimate goal can only be reached by\nstages.\" I have no doubt but the first stage in land\nlaw reform must be through the transition state I\nhave indicated above.\n\nfeel constrained to come to this conclusion,\nbecause it is evidently too much to expect that a\npeople who have been educated into the belief\u2014\ntrained into the belief\u2014preached into the belief\u2014 ,\nand coerced into the belief\u2014that the landlords have\na divine right\u2014a prescriptive right\u2014and, in short,\nall manner of rights to a monopoly of private pro-\nperty in land. I say that I think it would be ex-\npecting too much for a people thus taught, trained,\nand habituated to be persuaded all at once to give\nup their long cherished views and notions, or have\nany correct appreciation of the incalculable benefits\nthat would accrue to the whole population by re-\nlieving them of the incubus and dead-weights of\nrack-reutism, consequent upon landlordism. When\nwe hear those from whom we expect better things\ndeclare that if the land was national property \"it\nwould make no difference in the amount of rent\nrequired of the tenant,\" we cannot expect the mul-\ntitude to be mach better acquainted with the objects,\ntendency, and general advantages that would be\nderived by the whole community from the land\nbecoming public property.\nThe real advanced thinkers and workers in this great\ncause must exercise great forbearance to well -meaning\nmen of this class, and permit without molestation\ntheir prejudices and their predilections to accompany\nthem quietly to the grave. It, however, belongs to\nthe rising generation--to the young and vigorous\nmanhood of England to teach and indoctrinate the\nyouth of our country, and enlighten their minds so\nas to produce united action in removing the errors of\npast legislation relating to land. All that is re-\nquired of those who have faith in the great prin-\nciple of man's natural and inalienable right of in-\nheritance on the soil is\u2014that they should go forth\nwith a singleness of purpose, and work energeti-\nsally \u2022 and as sure as to-morrow's sun will rise and\nsacce;ol the midnight gloom\u2014the light of calm\nand sincere reflection will enlighten their under-\nstandings, awaken their sagacity, and call forth their\nreasoning powers, when justice and intelligence will\neverywhere proclaim that our common mother earth\nought to be as free to our access as the air and light\nof heaven, or the waters of the ocean, and made\ninheritable to us all.\n\nIn the meantime let us render every assistance to\nenter the first stage or transition state on our\njourney when those who may wish to lag behind o\nremain stationary will discover they are only rest\ning at the half-way house, and will then have t\nfollow the pioneers and advocates of national pro-\nperty in land to their final destination. We may\nall join in breaking up the present land monopoly\nwithout in any way abandoning the nationalisation\nprinciple ; just as John Stuart Mill voted for house-\nbold suffrage without abandoning the advocacy of\nwhat some wise people are pleased to call his \"dream\"\nof female suffrage, but which appears, after\nall, to be awakening a good many very drowsy\npeople who have been slumbering all their\nlives with regard to this subject. Speaking of\n\"dreams,\" there WIS a certain naval engineer con-\nceived the idea and dreamt the \"dream\" of sending\nthe first steamship from the shores of England to\nAmerica; but the unbelievers, like others of the\n-same genus, se3ffed and predicted that the ship\nwould founder before she had been twenty-four\nhours at sea; but the vessel arrived safe notwith-\nstanding their gloomy forebodings. A still more\n\"dreamy\" idea to the sceptics was the \"dream\" of\nconnecting the Western with the Eastern world by\nan electric cable. The alliance of peoples and the\nestablishment of peace among civilized nations is\nalso considered a \"dream\" by the anchorites, who\nhave rso faith in anything, and those who live and\nhave their being by the fomentation of wars and\nstrife. But, somehow or other, two of the above-\nnamed \" dreams \" have become realities, and so\nwould the freedom of the soil, the establishment of\npeace and goodwill among men if it suited the land-\nlord and the monied interest to make them so.\n\nHowever, it would be better for the generality of\npeople even if they were occasionally \"dreaming\"\nabout these subjects than be moving about in a state\nof semi-somnambulism until they knock their heads\nagainst some prominent object or public question,\nwhieh they show they have never thought much\nabout, and are little acquainted with, and conse-\nquentlydiscourses about them in true stoical fashion.\nHitherto the money lords and the landlords have\nturned to their own advantage all mechanical and\nscientific inventions, and if all the entailed estates of\nthe United Kingdom were in the market for sale to-\nmorrow, the men with the money bags are the men\nthat would profit most by the trensaqtion. Thus\nthe land would, to a considerable extent, in due\ncourse, pass from the hands of the great landlords\nto the money lords, and to choose between the two\nclasses, the \"proud patrician\" is preferable to the\nastute and exacting \" Shylock\" who will have his\n\"bond,\" that is to 4ay, his interest and his rack-\nrent, or otherwise his \"pound of flesh,\" by which\nis meant the goods, the chattels, the estate and\neffects of all who might have the misfortune to come\nwithin his clutches and could not help themselves.\nYet, notwithstanding this unfavourable complexion\nof the subject, a\u2022 great point would be gained by\nabolishing the present huge monopoly in land, and\nenabling it to be freely bought, and sold, and con-\nveyed as easy and inexpensive as any other kind of\nproperty. Because, as soon as this can be accom-\nplished, there are thiee very powerful agents that\nwould then materially, assist the people to get a\nfirm hold upon the land during the transition state,\nnamely, co-operative production, which could then\nbe extended to agricultural pursuits, currency, and\ncredit -reform, and a truly comprehensive system of\nnational education. For the rest we may very fairly\ntrust to the future.\n\nI have alluded to currency reform becanVi\u2014inde\u2014r\nthe present Bank monopoly, the monetary power\nof England has a great deal more to do in strength-\nening and supporting the land monopoly than some\npeople have ever \" dreamt \" of in their philosophy.\nThis reminds me of a correspondence I lately had\nwith a gentleman who has some inclination to be a\nland-law reformer, if he only knew how ; and who\nalso has certain misgivings about the justice and\nsoundness of our currency laws, and yet declared\nthat he \"would not permit a single note to be issued\nwithout a sovereign to back it.\" - Upon reading this\ndeclaration I began to feel some anxiety as to\nwhether he had any friends or not, because, if he\nhas, the Soon.er they look after him the better.\nPoliticians in swaddling cloths decidedly require\nlooking after, and as there is some promise of better\nthings coming from this gentleman in future, I\nstrong recommend him and all those answering the\nsame type, to place themselves under the care of\nproper tutors and guardians as soon as possible.\nIf any further proof were wanted of the connec-\ntion between the landed and the monied power,\nand the use that is made of the Bank nionopoly by\nthe Government of the day, we have it in the fact\nthat the present Government of landlords, after\nhaving commenced a foreign war during the Parlia-\nmentary vacation, go to the Br.nlc of England; which\nis the State banker, the Issue Department being\nplaced under their control by law, by which they\ncan dip.their hands into the coffers of the Bank and\ntake out the \u00a32,000,000 they require to commence\nthe Abyssinian War. and put on an income-tax to\n\nRUPTURES.

In that notice it\nwarns all lodges against taking any members that\nhave been working on the gaol at Manchester.\nDoes it at the same time eve the reasotes for\ngiving that notice ?\u2014The whole reasons have been\nprinted before warning the members not to came to\nthe place.\nDo you knew what statement was made at that\ntime in this circular P\u2014Not exactly.\nDo you know to what effect it was at all The\neffect was that there was a strike at the gaol eon-\neequenee of my putting a labeurer to carry first (it\nwas a true ,statement that was in, I believe), and\nthat the tricklayers had *taken sides with the\nktbourers, and did not wish any bricklayert\u2022to come\nuntil the die,pute was settle.\nI suppoee upon that the funds were obtained from\nthe diterert districts P\u2014No, district lodges have not '\npaid any ,coatribution towards that any further'\nthan what :has come out of the general 'fznd.\nWhat do you call \" the genera.l fund P,'!\n\u2014All enembers belonging to the 'bricklayers'i\nassociation are supposedle pay 4d. a week.

The -surplare\ngees to the occident fund. \u2022\nI want to know what you call \u2022\"the _generesl;l\nfund \"\u2014That is the general fund. They send\n10. to the trade portion and 10. to the accident,\nto the general fund, andievery branch 'beeps a Id.:\nto support \u2022ite own private claims. To get any.\nprivilege :from their private funds \u2022thee-- must .first\nmaintain it for twelve months or two years as .a!\nnotice to liezome law, and when it is passed, if\nthere should lie a strike at any time on that -same\nprivilege, ;they are supperted from ttete general!.\nfund.\n\nThat general fund 'being collected iroza the!\ndifferent branohes-?\u2014Thatzeneral fund !being ,col-i\nlected in about 70 or 80 'branches.\nAll over the country\nMr. Harrison: In this case did the otherdistriet\nsupport the Manchester dodge ?\u2014No, inet at this\ntime last ye. The strike had been !prolonged\nabout two atad.athalf years. Threugh my printing,\na pamphlet and showing them how they,eanducted\ntheir business on the executive council, there was a\ndelegate meeting .called, and when this delegate\nmeeting was called they were asked a queation on\nthe subject. I had-stated that they had ovec \u00a3BOO\nfrom the general fund, and when they were asked\nthe question wheater they had had that muck from\nthe general fnnd they had to acknowledge that they\nhad \u00a3920 for the Furosesof this strike, and that\nthe country lodges did not know that they had had\na penny at the time.\nThe other district iedges did not agree to give any\nsupport to the Manchester lodge ii this strike\u2014\nThey never were asked.\nAnd the executive being in Manchester borrowed\nfrom the funds of the other districts money to meet\nthis Manchester ledge strike P\u2014The Manchester\nLodge Committee 'aorrowed it from the executive\ncouncil without the sanction of the .her branches\n\u2014they did not ask the other branches for the loan\nsf it.\nChairman: Did not the other branches sanction\nit in the end ?\u2014They did at this delegate meeting,\nwhen the questioa was brought on about the\nexpenses, about their owing this money. The\nquestion was whetherthey would make the Man-\nchester lodge pay tlis \u00a3920, for the Manchester\nlodge made a claim of that, because they made it\nout that I had fetched London society men into\nManchester in crder to import another branch\u2014that\nis to say, to \u00b0pee another lodge in Manchester. On\nthat account they claimed it as a general strike, as\na legal strike. The delegates who were collected\ntogether decided that they would sanction the\nManchester lodge being made a present of this \u00a3920\nfor the purposes of the strike by the executive\ncouncil.\nBecause some delegates from London had been\nbrought down they approved of it. A delegate\nmeeting of the whole body voted that that money\nshould be sanctioned P\u2014Becanse I had fetched men\nfrom Leamington belonging to the London society\nthey made it appear as if I had wished to introduce\na fresh society into the town of Manchester.\nThat is the reason why the suffrages of all the\nmembers were in favour of paving that \u00a3920 ?\nYes, the London society and the Manchester society\nwere at variance at that time, they would not work\none 'with the other, and through my fetching the\nLoudon society men to this job they sent Edward\nCoulson from London down to Manchester to fetch\nthese men off. The two societies agreed at that\ntime. He came down specially for that purpose.\nSir D. Gooch: Is that the Mr. Coulson who has\ngiven evidence here ?\u2014Yes.\nEarl of Lichfield: Did they assign any other\nreason for striking besides the one you have referred\nto, in consequence of your appointing a certain man\nleader of a gang ?\u2014No, it was all for putting this\nleader to carry first that they struck, that was the\nsole reason; they could not prove anything that\never I had done amiss to the society, or that I had\nworked against the rules, and I have been 19 years\na member on the 2nd of June,\n\nOf that society P\u2014Of that tiociety. No one can\nwork in Manchester unless he does belong to it. As\nsoon as a man gets a job his card is demanded, and\nif he has not a card he must knock off.\n\nWhen did you cease to be a member of this\nsociety P\u2014l owed six weeks' Icontributions when\nthey shelved me, and I have rkever paid anything\nsince.\n\nSir D. Gooch: What. do yoii. call \"shelving ?\"\n7-Trying to force one off the job, that is what they\n\nterm \"shelving.\"\nMr. Harrison: Did you atm\nthe lodges whilst ---\nYes.\n\nHave you ever been present when anything like\na case of trade outrage has been brought 'before the\nnotice of the lodge in any way P\u2014 -tioned by\nthe society of bricklayers. I nel. .e brick-\nlayers to sanction any assault ,in Itl was\nconnected with them, but some members\nthat have been on their own account have committed.\nan assault. In the case of Archibald Neale job,\nat Oldham, there was a man who went over there\nand Mused the men, I believe.\n\nDid the society or the executive take any steps\nupon that ?--No, not to pay money or anything,\nthey did not approve of it.\nDid they show disapproval of it in any way ?\nYes, the bricklayers never did approve of it.\nYou have never known any case of outrage or\nviolence which has been sanctiond by any lodge or\nby the executive P\u2014Not by the bricklayers.\nEarl of Lichfield: In what way did they signify\ntheir disapproval P\u2014The way it is generally done is\nto stop the bricks or to work with the other trades\nand stop the joiners for instance. If they could\nnot do it themselves they would prevail on another\ntrade to come out.\nMy question is this: in what way did they sig-\nnify their disapproval of this outrage that you say\nwas perpetrated by one of their members ?\u2014They\ntold him that that they did not agree with anything\nof the sort.\nSir D. Gooch : They did not fine him for that ?\n\u2014No, they never inflicted any sort of fine, but they\ndid not approve of it they said.\nMr. Harrison: You were speaking just now of\nwhat they did towards employers with whom they\nhad a difficulty, but with respect to the intimidation\nof members, have you ever known of any case of\noutrage (or \" rattening \" as they call it at Sheffield)\nhaving been sanctioned by a lodge or by an officer\nagainst a defaulting member P\u2014No.\nMr. Booth: But those pickets that you have told\nus interfered with the non-union men whom you\nwere employing were appointed, I suppose, by union\nbricklayers P\u2014They were appointed by union brick-\nlayers.\nAnd, in some instances at least, they used a\ncertain degree of violence towards your men, did\nthey not P\u2014l never knew any violence used, except\nin this way, to the bricklayers working on it. It\nwas done by the labourers; they waylaid the men\nas they were going home alongside the railway\nstation. Some \u2022of the labourers were armed with\nsoda-water bottles, and one had an iron bar, and\nsome of the others had sticks.\nThen those labourers were not employed by the\nunion in any way F\u2014They were union men; the\ndelegate was one of them that walked about.\nButdid the union, as far as you know, express\nany disapproval of that proceeding ?\u2014I was not in\nconnexion with them then.\nYou do not know therefore ?\u2014No.\n\nSir D. Gooch: Do these men keep a delegate, a\nsort of police officer, walking about ?\u2014Yes, each\nsociety.\nWhat do these clelates do hey go round to\nthe different jobs, Iliad if there is a man working\nwhom they do not know, or that they think behind\nwith his contributions, they .ask him for his card,\n.and if he has not a card he has to pay so much\nmoney, generally Ss. (the 'entrance fee is \u00a3l, and\nthey generally give them a month to pay their \u201eV\nin), and if he does not pay they withdraw the other\n,en.\nThat class of Taal' is paid, I presume, by the\n-sieiety ?\u2014Yes.\nHe is an idle inan, he does not work 9\u2014He is a\nman that does PA work at all. How long does his\nposition last ?\u2014The last one that was On was\nMichael Coney, and to my knowledge he has been\non for nine years. I think that the roson wky\nthey kept him ,on so long was that he .was a erip,ple,\nand. his fingers were run up together. Still thu\npaid him the >same money as .any of the men :kept\non work.\n\nWhat do they pay this imam ?\u2014He moceives 36g\u2022\na week now.; the wages are advanced 3s. a week\nin Manchester :new.\n\nHe is paid. pretty much the same as-the meu.?\n\u2014Exactly the-seine.\nIf they get Lid of an inspector of that kind does\nhe return to the trade 9\u2014Yes, he would have, o do\nso. This one wits on the accident fundrand received\nOs. a week when disabled, .and if struck off from\ndelegate work he would have to.go back to that.\nIs it the practice to keep these men on, \u2018er is this\nau exceptional case ?\u2014Yes, it is .exceptiontl.\nHow long do they usually remain on P\u2014They\n,pro-\nfess to elect their officers for three months, after\nthat they elect another.\nEarl of Lichfield: You talk .about a ,committee\nhaving been established in the :next house to you.;\nwas that a committee of the bricklayers' seciety or\nof the labourers' society P\u2014Thy were mixed all to-\ngether. It was furnished .by the brickla\u201eyers ; it\nwas furnished by this .James Powers, the toeasurer\n,for the bricklayers' cociety \u2022 they took the room from\nthe woman who scoupied the next house and fur-\nitished it.\n\nThat was done 'by the bricklayers' society:?\u2014Yes.\nMat was done by the 'bricklayers' society.\nDid not you say that .at one of Sheir meetings ,a\nparson was there who was accused of having taken\npart in the outrage you have referred to, and .also\n:another person, a witn.ec-,3 ?\u2014Yes, Jan Nolan. He\nwas tried at the sessions for the assautlt on Wilfred,\nand Carr, the principal witness that swore to ,him\nwas drinking with him in the same hause about two\ndays after he got his release.\nThen you say that the .committee of the brick,\nlayers' society and the committee of the labourers'\nsociety were acting together in this house next door\nto you ?\u2014Yes, the joiners and all.\nThey had all combined F\u2014Through wiling the\njoiners out of the assize ,eoults they had all com-\nbined together, and when I had to come home to\nmy meals from work I had to pats througk perhaps\na score ,of them.\nThis house was taken for them cli to meet in ?\nYes. For them all to meet in.\n\nOf ,course each society had its own proper Qffices\nas well .P\u2014Yes.\n\nBut upon this occasion they took the house next\nto you in order that they might all meet there r\nYes. Them was a beerhouse at the corner ; the\nlandlord acted as the agent for this property, and\nthey got the landlord to get a house for them. He\nwent to the next door but one on the opposite side,\nwhere they took the hoe and asked a woman if\nshe could spare any rooms. She said that she had\nnone to spare, but that he might find a house in\nanother row. He said, \"It will not do in another\nrow, it must be under the same roof.\" But when\nthey could not do any harm or intimidate ma to leave\nthe job, they got the landlord to give me notice to\nleave, because otherwise some of his houses would be\nset on fire.\n\nWho was the landlord ?\u2014His name is Miller; he\nkeeps an eating house in Market-street; he was\nformerly in the marble trade.\nDo you say that he had notice that if you were\nnot turned out of the house the house would be set\non fire ?\u2014This landlord at the earner said, or he got\ntwo or three of the neighbours to sign a paper to\nsay, that their houses were in danger of being set\non fire by the society men, on account of my being\nallowed to live there.\n\nWho got that done ?\u2014Beard, the beerhouse\nkeeper, did it.\nMr. Verivale : Do you mean that Beard was in\nthe interest of this union society ?\u2014He acted in\ntheir interest on account of having men to drink at\nhis house.\n\nHe is not a member of that ociety P\u2014Not that I\nknow of; he might be of the ;oiners ; he is P. joiner\nby trade..\nEarl of Lichfield: At any I ate, do you speak\npositively with regard to that, that the landlord re-\nceived that notice P\u2014We had it from the parties\nwhom he wanted to sign the pap_r.\nMr. Merivale : Who told you tl.is ?\u2014One of the\ntenants.\n\nWas he a man that Beard came to P\u2014Yes.\nBeard not being the landlord himself ?\u2014No, the\nagent._\n\n-Earl of Lichfield : Did you leave ?\u2014Yes.\nDid not you remonstrate with hi tt ?\u2014lt was not\nto me he gave it, but my wife. I went and got\nanother house, and one of the club men followed the\ncart to see where the cart was going to when we left\nthe house.\n\nDid they establish any offices next door to you\nthere P\u2014No, they never took any step there, but\nthey followed the cart to see where I went to.\nChairman: Did you know the landlord of the new\nas he a chance man that had a house to\n' you know him ?\u2014I went round, 4nd a\nme that there were some houses to let\n\nthere. We went and inquired who was the land-\nlord, and they told us the landlady, and she let me\nthe house without any words.\nDid she know the circumstance F\u2014l told her.\nThey have not made any attacks on women yet as\nfar as we have heard P\u2014No, they have never taken\nany step excepting that.\nMr. Harrison : You de not consider yourself in\ndanger of any other kind of.interference, I suppose?\n\u2014Of course they never allow any man to work for\nus, not yet. About a month or six weeks ago this\noccurred. Mrs. Bramall had two houses to build at\nMoss Side, and she sent to Mr. Worthington, the\ncontractor (he is a brickmaker as well) to know if\nhe would supply bricks for those two houses, and he\nsent word that he could not. I went on Higgins's\nwork (he is a master brickmaker) and I asked his\nbrickmakers whether it was an order from them or I\nwhether Worthington was takinc, the step on his\nown responsibility, and they said they had served\na circular from their society to every master brick-\nmaker not to allow Mrs. Braman to have any bricks.\nShe has to give up the whole of her trade, except\nthe gaol.\nChairman: Ts there any particular kind of land\nwhere brick earth is to be found that limits the ,\nbrickmaking in Manchester' or is the whole of the\ncounty brick land; is it in fact brick clay all over\nthe county P\u2014On the west side of Manchester there\nis not much clay. It is chiefly on the north and\neast sides.\nEarl of Lichfield: What district do you call\nthat ?\u2014Ashton Road district, and Hyde Road and\nStockport Road. When we get up to Stetford on\nthe Cheshire side, there is not muck clay. The\nstrongest clay is on Hyde Road and Stockport Road.\nWhen did you say Mr. Braman died P\u2014About\ntwo years last March.\nThat was after this dispute took place P\u2014Yes, he\ndied the March after the occurrence. The occur-\nrence was on the 11th of April, and he died the\nMarch after.\nHe stood by you throughout P\u2014He stood by me\nthroughout. I was asked by Mr. -Waterhouse to\nget another job through the annoyance that the\nclub men caused to him.\nDo you think that there are many men in your\nexperience who would have stood out against the\ndictation ef the unions in that manner, and kept\nyou in their employ P\u2014l would not have Come if\nthey had not stuck by me, because I had a good\nsituation where I was.\n\nYou were sure that he would stand by you ?-11e\nsaid he would stand by me as long as I did my duty,\nand cf course I tried to do my duty on both sides.\nlie .guaranteed to stand by me as long as I did my\nduty, and of course he did so.\nAnd you feel confident that they never assigned\nany other grievance against you except that you\ndismissed this foreman you have referred to F\u2014That\nwas the only plea that they had, because I put this\nlabourer to go first, and he was the last that came.\nYou are sure that they never assigned any other\nreason 9\u2014They never assigned any other reason in\npoint, nor said anything else, except the man whose\nwork cost 4s. pec yard for nine-inch work.\n\nMr. Merivalc Who was it that this society used\nto send to talk to yon\u2014the delegate P\u2014A delegate\ncame to say *at these men must take their former\nplace. They never came there, but we carried on\nthe job; as aong as they would not come to us we\nwould not go to them, we got the men as best we\ncould. We wo id not make any concessions.\nEarl of Lichfield: You are still employed on the\nsame work T\u2014Yes.\n\nHave any union men come P\u2014Some.edd ones, only\ndefaulting men, wile have not paid their arrears.\nThey are mostly non-society men that you em- I\nploy P\u2014Yes., and msehine-made brieht,\n--Is it at the rate laid tdown by the nuion that the\nmen are paid by ycu, or according to efficiency?\u2014\nWe guarantee allihemen that cometonthat job Man-\nchester wages and.pri\u2022vileges. We have never taken\nany advantage of them, and when hare found men\nthat have .been above Ttfle average, I have given them\n6d. a dav,extra above Manchester wages.\n\nHave you. never paid less P\u2014To one or two that\nhave been inferior, not,competent to take his place\nwith the other men, but: not to any one that is a fair\naverage 'bricklayer.\nHave you done so in any other trade, the joinere,\nor any \u2022other trade connected with the job P\u2014To\nfurnish the assize\u2022courtE we had to rais3 the jo nevi'\nwages, which were 28s. to 345., and to give thearra\nguarantee of ..-C2 if they stop on the job till the\nassize courtE were finished. -\n\nHave you paid them all the same 'wages ?\u2014We\nhave paid th\u2022em all Manchester wages since. That\nwas a special understanding. There huve been two\n;advances with the joiners and two advances with\nhe bricklayers, and when the Manchester men have\nadvanced we have advanf;ed too.\n\nWhen a man is not worth the average ,wages, you\n:discharge him, jsuppose.F\u2014ln some caees we have\n;paid him what he is worth.\n. Something below thetregular rate P\u2014Yes, what he\n;is worth in yroportiontothe other.\nMr. Harriso\u00df.: What .number of those:eases have\nyou P\u2014Only one, I;thiuk, mow.\nMr. Hughes:: Why did you say that yzu would\nguarantee the joe.ners.\u00a32 P\u2014Because we had :to finish\ntheteourts by the 1.26 th of luly, and at that time\nthere were no joieers on t all; we had to he put\nto that expense, kf s. .a week :extra, and \u00a32 to induce\nth\u2018tm .to stop till that time. That was tctr,ptation\nto them so that tie 'society imen F.hould not draw\nthem off.\n\nWas it a bonus GC P\u2014A ibonus of -02 the\nJump., besides 6s. a week extra.\nMr. Rarrison : You were doing precisely win. the\nunion was doing, they were bribing the men te ztay\naway and you bribed them to come ?\u2014Yes Ave\ncould tr, ot get men on the job\nEarl of Lichfield: In short, you (could not get 4-ze\neontract completed without this .additional bonu of\n.a.?\u2014Yes, that was to ktop the delegate from\nget-\nting .at them an enticing them off tize work, it was I,\ndone because we thought that they would not leave\nthose two pounds, but would stop at the work.\nMr, Hughes.: You gave these very high wages in:\nconsequence of the action of the union P\u2014We were\nobliged to do so.\nBut for the union you would not have given these\nhigh wages P\u2014No, we said that they should have\nthe same privileges.\nThis instance, of course, was a special case in\nwhich the action of the union forced you to give\nhigher wages; but do you think that in general the\naction of the Union keeps up wages ?\u2014Yes, it cer-\ntainly does, because when I went to Barrow-in-\nFurness there was no society there, and they\nestablished a society there and about twelve months\nafter the society was established they got up from\n4s. to ss. 94. per day.\nDo you think that that is to the advantage of the\nmen ?\u2014lt certainly is an advantage to a trade when\none trade has more than another, but it is not an\nadvantage to that trade when they all get up alike.\nDo you that on the whole the unions are an\nadvantage or a disadvantage to the men ?\u2014They\nare of most advantage to the inferior class of work-\n\nBut on the whole do you think that it would be\nfor the benefit of the men that the unions should be\nabolished P\u2014l think-it would be a benefit to the bese\nof the workmen.\nEarl _of Liebfield : Would it be a benefit to the\nmajority or to the minority ?\u2014The minority are the\nbest of the workmen.\n- -\n\nMr. Hughes: Therefore the abolition would\nbenefit the minority ?\u2014Perhaps one man about in\n-every ten would be above the average. If a master\nbricklayer was to give that man an extra 6d. the\nother men would make it out that he had given him\nthat extra 6d. to favour him, and then they would\ncome and demand it. There are plenty of cases in\nManchester in which some bricklayers are worth is.\na day more than the others.\nDo you think that if the unions were abolished\nfor the majority of men, the inferior workmen, the\nwages would fall P\u2014l certainly do think that if\ntrade societies were abolished they would fall, it is\nthe societies that have kept the wages up, although\ngood trade would raise wages at any time when\nthere is a scarcity of hands.\nBut do you think that the rise would come very\nquickly in that case ?It would not come so quickly\nas it does with the unions, because when one master\nhas to give more money to get men, the rest of the\nsociety men make a claim and of course they hav& a\nsociety at their back and they can do it better than\nindividual men can.\nYou do not think tlkat if the men were left to\nmake their, bargains as individuals with their\nmasters they, would get such high wages or so quick\na rise ?\u2014The best of the men would get the rise.\n_ _ _ .\n\nWe are speaking now of the majority P\u2014l do not\n\nthink they would get it so quick as with the society\nat their back.\nI think since Mr. Brarnall's death the busitreas\nhas heen carried on by his widow ?\u2014Yes, she is his\nsole executrix.\n\nAnd the unions have gone on to annoy her in the\nsame way as they annoyed him during his lifetime?\n\u2014The annoyance was all over before Mr. Bramalt\ndied.\nBut they interfere with her carrying on any other\nwork ?\u2014Ys, she had to give up all other trade, and\nMr. Bramall had also when he took the gaol on\naccount of using machine bricks.\nAnd that ban is still upon his window 9\u2014Yes, she\nhave neither joiners, bricklayers, nor hand-made\nbricks from club labour. The masons and plasterers\nnever had anything to do with it, nor subscribed that\nI know of. . .\n\n_\nChairman: What is the difference of cost in\nmachine-made brickwork as compared with the\nother ? Can you state what it is in a rod of nine-\ninch brickwork and that would give us a ratio ?\nThe shedule price orlour work is 2s. 3d. per yard,\nnine-inch work, and if it were hand-made bricks it\nwould be about 2s. 10d., then we should have to give\n19s. a 1,000 for them. The guarantee to\nBratnall was that the price of his bricks was 11\nper 1,000, and if he had had hand-made bricks the\nprice would be 19s, per 1,000, that is about 7d. dif-\nference in the yard of nine-inch brickwork.\nMr. Hughes: Do you think machine bricks much\nbetter than hand-made bricks 9\u2014There are some\nsorts of them that are very good. Platt's machine\nbricks are very good square bricks; they can lay\nthem a good deal better. We have used 8,000,000\nof Platt's bricks.\n\nYou think the extra pressure, perhaps, very ad-\nvantageous-40 tons on every brick one witness told\nus P\u2014Some say about 70.\nWhatever it is it must be very valuable P\u2014Yes.\nWe are building a chimney now, 226 feet high,\nwith about 1,003,000 of bricks in it, and fc.cin g it\nwith these pressed bricks of Platt's.\nMr. Roebuck: They are much harder than others,\nare they not P\u2014Yes.\nDid you ever hear of bricklayers making any\nobjection to use them because they were harder ?\nThey will not use them at all in Manchester. There\nis another matter I should like to refer to. The last\nwitness that came up spoke with regard to Thomas\nBarlow, who had to do with that murder of Jump,\nat Ashton. Barlow confessed, and just after the trial\nI had Barlow come to work on the same job where\nI was. About a dozen of the ;brickmakers belong-\ning to the Manchester society (I know one or two of\nthem by sight) came up to the job and wanted to\nknow if he were working there. I said he was, but\nwas not there that day, and they took and searched\neverywhere about the place to find Barlow. They\neven went in the office that I had put plans in, and\nlooked in the fire-place, and went to see if he had\nrun out into the road.\n\nDid you take no steps to punish those men for that\nact ?\u2014I was only foreman, just as I am now.\nDid your master take any steps P\u2014No.\nDid you complain to him P\u2014l told him that they\ncame up, but my idea was that they wanted to stop\nthe bricks.\n\nHad you any idea that it was an illegal proceed-\ning on their part P\u2014Of course I knew that it was\nillegal; I knew that they had ii. business to ooze\nand threaten anyone at the job.\n\nWho was your master then P\u2014Mr. Warburton.\nHe took no steps to punish them P\u2014No, he durst\nnot; if he did he must close all his other jobs.\nWe are to conclude then that he was under\ncoercion and error such as to compel him to allow\nan illegal offence to be committed without seeking\nto punish it P\u2014Yes ; if he had punished it they\nwould have stopped all his works.\nEarl of Lichfield : Was Barlow in any way con-\nnected with the management of any of these\nsocieties F--1 do not know; Barlow was a stranger\nto me altogether.\nMr. Roebuck: You know nothing of tra des'\nunions.?\u2014res, I was 19 years in one.\n\n(To be ,ocatinued.)\n\nTENDERS.\n\nFor girls' school and muter'a holm Tt 'Silva' Town, north\nWool ich.

Two hundred men were hard at\nwork when one of them struck into a fissure and in a\nmoment a strong current of gas burst forth that in an\nincredible space of time completely checked the ventila-\ntion. The men dew for their lives; one lame man\nnarrowly escaped suffocation, as he was not able to\nkeep pace with the rest. Happily no one was injured,\nand measures were at once taken to clear the workings\nof gas and restore the ventilation, Had this 'blower,'\nnot been discovered at the moment, or had there. been\none damaged lamp, all, or nearly all, of these two\nhundred men would have been sacrificed. No more\nstriking instance of the fact that awful calamities are at\nthe mercy of any man or boy in a pit has been given of\nlate years.\nSERIOUS ACCIDENT IN A FOUNDRY.

I am perfectly con-\nvinced that the only way of effecting a peaceful\nchange in the laws relating to land in this country\nin our onward march to the ultimate good of making\nthe land national property must be through a\ntransition state. I would say in regard to the land\nlaws precisely the same as Mr. Fox says in his in-\ntroductory letter on currency reform, in alluding to\nthe adoption of a system of equitable exchanges,\n\"that the ultimate goal can only be reached by\nstages.\" I have no doubt but the first stage in land\nlaw reform must be through the transition state I\nhave indicated above.\n\nfeel constrained to come to this conclusion,\nbecause it is evidently too much to expect that a\npeople who have been educated into the belief\u2014\ntrained into the belief\u2014preached into the belief\u2014 ,\nand coerced into the belief\u2014that the landlords have\na divine right\u2014a prescriptive right\u2014and, in short,\nall manner of rights to a monopoly of private pro-\nperty in land. I say that I think it would be ex-\npecting too much for a people thus taught, trained,\nand habituated to be persuaded all at once to give\nup their long cherished views and notions, or have\nany correct appreciation of the incalculable benefits\nthat would accrue to the whole population by re-\nlieving them of the incubus and dead-weights of\nrack-reutism, consequent upon landlordism. When\nwe hear those from whom we expect better things\ndeclare that if the land was national property \"it\nwould make no difference in the amount of rent\nrequired of the tenant,\" we cannot expect the mul-\ntitude to be mach better acquainted with the objects,\ntendency, and general advantages that would be\nderived by the whole community from the land\nbecoming public property.\nThe real advanced thinkers and workers in this great\ncause must exercise great forbearance to well -meaning\nmen of this class, and permit without molestation\ntheir prejudices and their predilections to accompany\nthem quietly to the grave. It, however, belongs to\nthe rising generation--to the young and vigorous\nmanhood of England to teach and indoctrinate the\nyouth of our country, and enlighten their minds so\nas to produce united action in removing the errors of\npast legislation relating to land. All that is re-\nquired of those who have faith in the great prin-\nciple of man's natural and inalienable right of in-\nheritance on the soil is\u2014that they should go forth\nwith a singleness of purpose, and work energeti-\nsally \u2022 and as sure as to-morrow's sun will rise and\nsacce;ol the midnight gloom\u2014the light of calm\nand sincere reflection will enlighten their under-\nstandings, awaken their sagacity, and call forth their\nreasoning powers, when justice and intelligence will\neverywhere proclaim that our common mother earth\nought to be as free to our access as the air and light\nof heaven, or the waters of the ocean, and made\ninheritable to us all.\n\nIn the meantime let us render every assistance to\nenter the first stage or transition state on our\njourney when those who may wish to lag behind o\nremain stationary will discover they are only rest\ning at the half-way house, and will then have t\nfollow the pioneers and advocates of national pro-\nperty in land to their final destination. We may\nall join in breaking up the present land monopoly\nwithout in any way abandoning the nationalisation\nprinciple ; just as John Stuart Mill voted for house-\nbold suffrage without abandoning the advocacy of\nwhat some wise people are pleased to call his \"dream\"\nof female suffrage, but which appears, after\nall, to be awakening a good many very drowsy\npeople who have been slumbering all their\nlives with regard to this subject. Speaking of\n\"dreams,\" there WIS a certain naval engineer con-\nceived the idea and dreamt the \"dream\" of sending\nthe first steamship from the shores of England to\nAmerica; but the unbelievers, like others of the\n-same genus, se3ffed and predicted that the ship\nwould founder before she had been twenty-four\nhours at sea; but the vessel arrived safe notwith-\nstanding their gloomy forebodings. A still more\n\"dreamy\" idea to the sceptics was the \"dream\" of\nconnecting the Western with the Eastern world by\nan electric cable. The alliance of peoples and the\nestablishment of peace among civilized nations is\nalso considered a \"dream\" by the anchorites, who\nhave rso faith in anything, and those who live and\nhave their being by the fomentation of wars and\nstrife. But, somehow or other, two of the above-\nnamed \" dreams \" have become realities, and so\nwould the freedom of the soil, the establishment of\npeace and goodwill among men if it suited the land-\nlord and the monied interest to make them so.\n\nHowever, it would be better for the generality of\npeople even if they were occasionally \"dreaming\"\nabout these subjects than be moving about in a state\nof semi-somnambulism until they knock their heads\nagainst some prominent object or public question,\nwhieh they show they have never thought much\nabout, and are little acquainted with, and conse-\nquentlydiscourses about them in true stoical fashion.\nHitherto the money lords and the landlords have\nturned to their own advantage all mechanical and\nscientific inventions, and if all the entailed estates of\nthe United Kingdom were in the market for sale to-\nmorrow, the men with the money bags are the men\nthat would profit most by the trensaqtion. Thus\nthe land would, to a considerable extent, in due\ncourse, pass from the hands of the great landlords\nto the money lords, and to choose between the two\nclasses, the \"proud patrician\" is preferable to the\nastute and exacting \" Shylock\" who will have his\n\"bond,\" that is to 4ay, his interest and his rack-\nrent, or otherwise his \"pound of flesh,\" by which\nis meant the goods, the chattels, the estate and\neffects of all who might have the misfortune to come\nwithin his clutches and could not help themselves.\nYet, notwithstanding this unfavourable complexion\nof the subject, a\u2022 great point would be gained by\nabolishing the present huge monopoly in land, and\nenabling it to be freely bought, and sold, and con-\nveyed as easy and inexpensive as any other kind of\nproperty. Because, as soon as this can be accom-\nplished, there are thiee very powerful agents that\nwould then materially, assist the people to get a\nfirm hold upon the land during the transition state,\nnamely, co-operative production, which could then\nbe extended to agricultural pursuits, currency, and\ncredit -reform, and a truly comprehensive system of\nnational education. For the rest we may very fairly\ntrust to the future.\n\nI have alluded to currency reform becanVi\u2014inde\u2014r\nthe present Bank monopoly, the monetary power\nof England has a great deal more to do in strength-\nening and supporting the land monopoly than some\npeople have ever \" dreamt \" of in their philosophy.\nThis reminds me of a correspondence I lately had\nwith a gentleman who has some inclination to be a\nland-law reformer, if he only knew how ; and who\nalso has certain misgivings about the justice and\nsoundness of our currency laws, and yet declared\nthat he \"would not permit a single note to be issued\nwithout a sovereign to back it.\" - Upon reading this\ndeclaration I began to feel some anxiety as to\nwhether he had any friends or not, because, if he\nhas, the Soon.er they look after him the better.\nPoliticians in swaddling cloths decidedly require\nlooking after, and as there is some promise of better\nthings coming from this gentleman in future, I\nstrong recommend him and all those answering the\nsame type, to place themselves under the care of\nproper tutors and guardians as soon as possible.\nIf any further proof were wanted of the connec-\ntion between the landed and the monied power,\nand the use that is made of the Bank nionopoly by\nthe Government of the day, we have it in the fact\nthat the present Government of landlords, after\nhaving commenced a foreign war during the Parlia-\nmentary vacation, go to the Br.nlc of England; which\nis the State banker, the Issue Department being\nplaced under their control by law, by which they\ncan dip.their hands into the coffers of the Bank and\ntake out the \u00a32,000,000 they require to commence\nthe Abyssinian War. and put on an income-tax to\n\nRUPTURES.

The writer said that I had under-\nmined my fellow-man or something to that effect, ,\nand it was the reverse. There was an article that\nappeared in the Spectator on the 21st of January\n1865, I think, and this which I hold in my hand is\nan article that was written as an answer to that;\nit was written by Mr. Little, Mr, Bra mall's\nmanager; it was for Mr. Braraall to send to the\nSpectator contradicting their article, but Mr.\nBram 1 was taken ill, and it never was printed,\nandkMr. Little wished me to leave this before the\nCommissioners just as it is.\nEarl of Lichfield: The statement made in the\nSpectator never has been answered P\u2014No, this is the\nanswer partly written.\nIt was not furnished in consequence of Mr. ,\nBramall's illness ?\u2014Just so; he has been dead two'\nyears in March.\nManchester is the centre of one of the largest 11\nsocieties of bricklayers, is it not P\u2014lt was previous\nto this time last year.\nWas it the centre of a large society at the time\nthat the strike took place through their demanding\nto have you dismissed P\u2014Yes, it was the head lodge;\nthe executive council, that is what it is called.\nThen the funds expended were collected I sup-\npose from the different districts ?\u2014lt was a local\nstrike ; it was not a general strike.\nPerhaps you cannot give any information on that\nsubject ?\u2014Yes, I can.\nDo you know how the funds were obtained P\u2014The\nfunds were obtained from the general fund, after ,\ntheir own lodge funds were exhausted they borrowedl\nmoney from the general fund; having the treasurer '\nand secretary and all in their own district. They\nmade use of that until they had \u00a3920 I believe from\nthe general fund. In consequence cf that I pub-\nlished a pamphlet, showing to the branch lodges\nhow the executive conducted the business, and that\nthe bricklayers published a report every month, and\npublished in that repeet a warning to all lodges\nagainst taking any members that have been work-\non the gaol.\nDo you see their report ?\u2014I have not seen that\nnumber.\nHow doyou know that then P\u2014l have been told\nby Manchester members and Bolton members, and\nby the president of the Barrow lodge.

The strike had been !prolonged\nabout two atad.athalf years. Threugh my printing,\na pamphlet and showing them how they,eanducted\ntheir business on the executive council, there was a\ndelegate meeting .called, and when this delegate\nmeeting was called they were asked a queation on\nthe subject. I had-stated that they had ovec \u00a3BOO\nfrom the general fund, and when they were asked\nthe question wheater they had had that muck from\nthe general fnnd they had to acknowledge that they\nhad \u00a3920 for the Furosesof this strike, and that\nthe country lodges did not know that they had had\na penny at the time.\nThe other district iedges did not agree to give any\nsupport to the Manchester lodge ii this strike\u2014\nThey never were asked.\nAnd the executive being in Manchester borrowed\nfrom the funds of the other districts money to meet\nthis Manchester ledge strike P\u2014The Manchester\nLodge Committee 'aorrowed it from the executive\ncouncil without the sanction of the .her branches\n\u2014they did not ask the other branches for the loan\nsf it.\nChairman: Did not the other branches sanction\nit in the end ?\u2014They did at this delegate meeting,\nwhen the questioa was brought on about the\nexpenses, about their owing this money. The\nquestion was whetherthey would make the Man-\nchester lodge pay tlis \u00a3920, for the Manchester\nlodge made a claim of that, because they made it\nout that I had fetched London society men into\nManchester in crder to import another branch\u2014that\nis to say, to \u00b0pee another lodge in Manchester. On\nthat account they claimed it as a general strike, as\na legal strike. The delegates who were collected\ntogether decided that they would sanction the\nManchester lodge being made a present of this \u00a3920\nfor the purposes of the strike by the executive\ncouncil.\nBecause some delegates from London had been\nbrought down they approved of it. A delegate\nmeeting of the whole body voted that that money\nshould be sanctioned P\u2014Becanse I had fetched men\nfrom Leamington belonging to the London society\nthey made it appear as if I had wished to introduce\na fresh society into the town of Manchester.\nThat is the reason why the suffrages of all the\nmembers were in favour of paving that \u00a3920 ?\nYes, the London society and the Manchester society\nwere at variance at that time, they would not work\none 'with the other, and through my fetching the\nLoudon society men to this job they sent Edward\nCoulson from London down to Manchester to fetch\nthese men off. The two societies agreed at that\ntime. He came down specially for that purpose.\nSir D. Gooch: Is that the Mr. Coulson who has\ngiven evidence here ?\u2014Yes.\nEarl of Lichfield: Did they assign any other\nreason for striking besides the one you have referred\nto, in consequence of your appointing a certain man\nleader of a gang ?\u2014No, it was all for putting this\nleader to carry first that they struck, that was the\nsole reason; they could not prove anything that\never I had done amiss to the society, or that I had\nworked against the rules, and I have been 19 years\na member on the 2nd of June,\n\nOf that society P\u2014Of that tiociety. No one can\nwork in Manchester unless he does belong to it. As\nsoon as a man gets a job his card is demanded, and\nif he has not a card he must knock off.\n\nWhen did you cease to be a member of this\nsociety P\u2014l owed six weeks' Icontributions when\nthey shelved me, and I have rkever paid anything\nsince.\n\nSir D. Gooch: What. do yoii. call \"shelving ?\"\n7-Trying to force one off the job, that is what they\n\nterm \"shelving.\"\nMr. Harrison: Did you atm\nthe lodges whilst ---\nYes.\n\nHave you ever been present when anything like\na case of trade outrage has been brought 'before the\nnotice of the lodge in any way P\u2014 -tioned by\nthe society of bricklayers. I nel. .e brick-\nlayers to sanction any assault ,in Itl was\nconnected with them, but some members\nthat have been on their own account have committed.\nan assault. In the case of Archibald Neale job,\nat Oldham, there was a man who went over there\nand Mused the men, I believe.\n\nDid the society or the executive take any steps\nupon that ?--No, not to pay money or anything,\nthey did not approve of it.\nDid they show disapproval of it in any way ?\nYes, the bricklayers never did approve of it.\nYou have never known any case of outrage or\nviolence which has been sanctiond by any lodge or\nby the executive P\u2014Not by the bricklayers.\nEarl of Lichfield: In what way did they signify\ntheir disapproval P\u2014The way it is generally done is\nto stop the bricks or to work with the other trades\nand stop the joiners for instance. If they could\nnot do it themselves they would prevail on another\ntrade to come out.\nMy question is this: in what way did they sig-\nnify their disapproval of this outrage that you say\nwas perpetrated by one of their members ?\u2014They\ntold him that that they did not agree with anything\nof the sort.\nSir D. Gooch : They did not fine him for that ?\n\u2014No, they never inflicted any sort of fine, but they\ndid not approve of it they said.\nMr. Harrison: You were speaking just now of\nwhat they did towards employers with whom they\nhad a difficulty, but with respect to the intimidation\nof members, have you ever known of any case of\noutrage (or \" rattening \" as they call it at Sheffield)\nhaving been sanctioned by a lodge or by an officer\nagainst a defaulting member P\u2014No.\nMr. Booth: But those pickets that you have told\nus interfered with the non-union men whom you\nwere employing were appointed, I suppose, by union\nbricklayers P\u2014They were appointed by union brick-\nlayers.\nAnd, in some instances at least, they used a\ncertain degree of violence towards your men, did\nthey not P\u2014l never knew any violence used, except\nin this way, to the bricklayers working on it. It\nwas done by the labourers; they waylaid the men\nas they were going home alongside the railway\nstation. Some \u2022of the labourers were armed with\nsoda-water bottles, and one had an iron bar, and\nsome of the others had sticks.\nThen those labourers were not employed by the\nunion in any way F\u2014They were union men; the\ndelegate was one of them that walked about.\nButdid the union, as far as you know, express\nany disapproval of that proceeding ?\u2014I was not in\nconnexion with them then.\nYou do not know therefore ?\u2014No.\n\nSir D. Gooch: Do these men keep a delegate, a\nsort of police officer, walking about ?\u2014Yes, each\nsociety.\nWhat do these clelates do hey go round to\nthe different jobs, Iliad if there is a man working\nwhom they do not know, or that they think behind\nwith his contributions, they .ask him for his card,\n.and if he has not a card he has to pay so much\nmoney, generally Ss. (the 'entrance fee is \u00a3l, and\nthey generally give them a month to pay their \u201eV\nin), and if he does not pay they withdraw the other\n,en.\nThat class of Taal' is paid, I presume, by the\n-sieiety ?\u2014Yes.\nHe is an idle inan, he does not work 9\u2014He is a\nman that does PA work at all. How long does his\nposition last ?\u2014The last one that was On was\nMichael Coney, and to my knowledge he has been\non for nine years. I think that the roson wky\nthey kept him ,on so long was that he .was a erip,ple,\nand. his fingers were run up together. Still thu\npaid him the >same money as .any of the men :kept\non work.\n\nWhat do they pay this imam ?\u2014He moceives 36g\u2022\na week now.; the wages are advanced 3s. a week\nin Manchester :new.\n\nHe is paid. pretty much the same as-the meu.?\n\u2014Exactly the-seine.\nIf they get Lid of an inspector of that kind does\nhe return to the trade 9\u2014Yes, he would have, o do\nso. This one wits on the accident fundrand received\nOs. a week when disabled, .and if struck off from\ndelegate work he would have to.go back to that.\nIs it the practice to keep these men on, \u2018er is this\nau exceptional case ?\u2014Yes, it is .exceptiontl.\nHow long do they usually remain on P\u2014They\n,pro-\nfess to elect their officers for three months, after\nthat they elect another.\nEarl of Lichfield: You talk .about a ,committee\nhaving been established in the :next house to you.;\nwas that a committee of the bricklayers' seciety or\nof the labourers' society P\u2014Thy were mixed all to-\ngether. It was furnished .by the brickla\u201eyers ; it\nwas furnished by this .James Powers, the toeasurer\n,for the bricklayers' cociety \u2022 they took the room from\nthe woman who scoupied the next house and fur-\nitished it.\n\nThat was done 'by the bricklayers' society:?\u2014Yes.\nMat was done by the 'bricklayers' society.\nDid not you say that .at one of Sheir meetings ,a\nparson was there who was accused of having taken\npart in the outrage you have referred to, and .also\n:another person, a witn.ec-,3 ?\u2014Yes, Jan Nolan. He\nwas tried at the sessions for the assautlt on Wilfred,\nand Carr, the principal witness that swore to ,him\nwas drinking with him in the same hause about two\ndays after he got his release.\nThen you say that the .committee of the brick,\nlayers' society and the committee of the labourers'\nsociety were acting together in this house next door\nto you ?\u2014Yes, the joiners and all.\nThey had all combined F\u2014Through wiling the\njoiners out of the assize ,eoults they had all com-\nbined together, and when I had to come home to\nmy meals from work I had to pats througk perhaps\na score ,of them.\nThis house was taken for them cli to meet in ?\nYes. For them all to meet in.\n\nOf ,course each society had its own proper Qffices\nas well .P\u2014Yes.\n\nBut upon this occasion they took the house next\nto you in order that they might all meet there r\nYes. Them was a beerhouse at the corner ; the\nlandlord acted as the agent for this property, and\nthey got the landlord to get a house for them. He\nwent to the next door but one on the opposite side,\nwhere they took the hoe and asked a woman if\nshe could spare any rooms. She said that she had\nnone to spare, but that he might find a house in\nanother row. He said, \"It will not do in another\nrow, it must be under the same roof.\" But when\nthey could not do any harm or intimidate ma to leave\nthe job, they got the landlord to give me notice to\nleave, because otherwise some of his houses would be\nset on fire.\n\nWho was the landlord ?\u2014His name is Miller; he\nkeeps an eating house in Market-street; he was\nformerly in the marble trade.\nDo you say that he had notice that if you were\nnot turned out of the house the house would be set\non fire ?\u2014This landlord at the earner said, or he got\ntwo or three of the neighbours to sign a paper to\nsay, that their houses were in danger of being set\non fire by the society men, on account of my being\nallowed to live there.\n\nWho got that done ?\u2014Beard, the beerhouse\nkeeper, did it.\nMr. Verivale : Do you mean that Beard was in\nthe interest of this union society ?\u2014He acted in\ntheir interest on account of having men to drink at\nhis house.\n\nHe is not a member of that ociety P\u2014Not that I\nknow of; he might be of the ;oiners ; he is P. joiner\nby trade..\nEarl of Lichfield: At any I ate, do you speak\npositively with regard to that, that the landlord re-\nceived that notice P\u2014We had it from the parties\nwhom he wanted to sign the pap_r.\nMr. Merivale : Who told you tl.is ?\u2014One of the\ntenants.\n\nWas he a man that Beard came to P\u2014Yes.\nBeard not being the landlord himself ?\u2014No, the\nagent._\n\n-Earl of Lichfield : Did you leave ?\u2014Yes.\nDid not you remonstrate with hi tt ?\u2014lt was not\nto me he gave it, but my wife. I went and got\nanother house, and one of the club men followed the\ncart to see where the cart was going to when we left\nthe house.\n\nDid they establish any offices next door to you\nthere P\u2014No, they never took any step there, but\nthey followed the cart to see where I went to.\nChairman: Did you know the landlord of the new\nas he a chance man that had a house to\n' you know him ?\u2014I went round, 4nd a\nme that there were some houses to let\n\nthere. We went and inquired who was the land-\nlord, and they told us the landlady, and she let me\nthe house without any words.\nDid she know the circumstance F\u2014l told her.\nThey have not made any attacks on women yet as\nfar as we have heard P\u2014No, they have never taken\nany step excepting that.\nMr. Harrison : You de not consider yourself in\ndanger of any other kind of.interference, I suppose?\n\u2014Of course they never allow any man to work for\nus, not yet. About a month or six weeks ago this\noccurred. Mrs. Bramall had two houses to build at\nMoss Side, and she sent to Mr. Worthington, the\ncontractor (he is a brickmaker as well) to know if\nhe would supply bricks for those two houses, and he\nsent word that he could not. I went on Higgins's\nwork (he is a master brickmaker) and I asked his\nbrickmakers whether it was an order from them or I\nwhether Worthington was takinc, the step on his\nown responsibility, and they said they had served\na circular from their society to every master brick-\nmaker not to allow Mrs. Braman to have any bricks.\nShe has to give up the whole of her trade, except\nthe gaol.\nChairman: Ts there any particular kind of land\nwhere brick earth is to be found that limits the ,\nbrickmaking in Manchester' or is the whole of the\ncounty brick land; is it in fact brick clay all over\nthe county P\u2014On the west side of Manchester there\nis not much clay. It is chiefly on the north and\neast sides.\nEarl of Lichfield: What district do you call\nthat ?\u2014Ashton Road district, and Hyde Road and\nStockport Road. When we get up to Stetford on\nthe Cheshire side, there is not muck clay. The\nstrongest clay is on Hyde Road and Stockport Road.\nWhen did you say Mr. Braman died P\u2014About\ntwo years last March.\nThat was after this dispute took place P\u2014Yes, he\ndied the March after the occurrence. The occur-\nrence was on the 11th of April, and he died the\nMarch after.\nHe stood by you throughout P\u2014He stood by me\nthroughout. I was asked by Mr. -Waterhouse to\nget another job through the annoyance that the\nclub men caused to him.\nDo you think that there are many men in your\nexperience who would have stood out against the\ndictation ef the unions in that manner, and kept\nyou in their employ P\u2014l would not have Come if\nthey had not stuck by me, because I had a good\nsituation where I was.\n\nYou were sure that he would stand by you ?-11e\nsaid he would stand by me as long as I did my duty,\nand cf course I tried to do my duty on both sides.\nlie .guaranteed to stand by me as long as I did my\nduty, and of course he did so.\nAnd you feel confident that they never assigned\nany other grievance against you except that you\ndismissed this foreman you have referred to F\u2014That\nwas the only plea that they had, because I put this\nlabourer to go first, and he was the last that came.\nYou are sure that they never assigned any other\nreason 9\u2014They never assigned any other reason in\npoint, nor said anything else, except the man whose\nwork cost 4s. pec yard for nine-inch work.\n\nMr. Merivalc Who was it that this society used\nto send to talk to yon\u2014the delegate P\u2014A delegate\ncame to say *at these men must take their former\nplace. They never came there, but we carried on\nthe job; as aong as they would not come to us we\nwould not go to them, we got the men as best we\ncould. We wo id not make any concessions.\nEarl of Lichfield: You are still employed on the\nsame work T\u2014Yes.\n\nHave any union men come P\u2014Some.edd ones, only\ndefaulting men, wile have not paid their arrears.\nThey are mostly non-society men that you em- I\nploy P\u2014Yes., and msehine-made brieht,\n--Is it at the rate laid tdown by the nuion that the\nmen are paid by ycu, or according to efficiency?\u2014\nWe guarantee allihemen that cometonthat job Man-\nchester wages and.pri\u2022vileges. We have never taken\nany advantage of them, and when hare found men\nthat have .been above Ttfle average, I have given them\n6d. a dav,extra above Manchester wages.\n\nHave you. never paid less P\u2014To one or two that\nhave been inferior, not,competent to take his place\nwith the other men, but: not to any one that is a fair\naverage 'bricklayer.\nHave you done so in any other trade, the joinere,\nor any \u2022other trade connected with the job P\u2014To\nfurnish the assize\u2022courtE we had to rais3 the jo nevi'\nwages, which were 28s. to 345., and to give thearra\nguarantee of ..-C2 if they stop on the job till the\nassize courtE were finished. -\n\nHave you paid them all the same 'wages ?\u2014We\nhave paid th\u2022em all Manchester wages since. That\nwas a special understanding. There huve been two\n;advances with the joiners and two advances with\nhe bricklayers, and when the Manchester men have\nadvanced we have advanf;ed too.\n\nWhen a man is not worth the average ,wages, you\n:discharge him, jsuppose.F\u2014ln some caees we have\n;paid him what he is worth.\n. Something below thetregular rate P\u2014Yes, what he\n;is worth in yroportiontothe other.\nMr. Harriso\u00df.: What .number of those:eases have\nyou P\u2014Only one, I;thiuk, mow.\nMr. Hughes:: Why did you say that yzu would\nguarantee the joe.ners.\u00a32 P\u2014Because we had :to finish\ntheteourts by the 1.26 th of luly, and at that time\nthere were no joieers on t all; we had to he put\nto that expense, kf s. .a week :extra, and \u00a32 to induce\nth\u2018tm .to stop till that time. That was tctr,ptation\nto them so that tie 'society imen F.hould not draw\nthem off.\n\nWas it a bonus GC P\u2014A ibonus of -02 the\nJump., besides 6s. a week extra.\nMr. Rarrison : You were doing precisely win. the\nunion was doing, they were bribing the men te ztay\naway and you bribed them to come ?\u2014Yes Ave\ncould tr, ot get men on the job\nEarl of Lichfield: In short, you (could not get 4-ze\neontract completed without this .additional bonu of\n.a.?\u2014Yes, that was to ktop the delegate from\nget-\nting .at them an enticing them off tize work, it was I,\ndone because we thought that they would not leave\nthose two pounds, but would stop at the work.\nMr, Hughes.: You gave these very high wages in:\nconsequence of the action of the union P\u2014We were\nobliged to do so.\nBut for the union you would not have given these\nhigh wages P\u2014No, we said that they should have\nthe same privileges.\nThis instance, of course, was a special case in\nwhich the action of the union forced you to give\nhigher wages; but do you think that in general the\naction of the Union keeps up wages ?\u2014Yes, it cer-\ntainly does, because when I went to Barrow-in-\nFurness there was no society there, and they\nestablished a society there and about twelve months\nafter the society was established they got up from\n4s. to ss. 94. per day.\nDo you think that that is to the advantage of the\nmen ?\u2014lt certainly is an advantage to a trade when\none trade has more than another, but it is not an\nadvantage to that trade when they all get up alike.\nDo you that on the whole the unions are an\nadvantage or a disadvantage to the men ?\u2014They\nare of most advantage to the inferior class of work-\n\nBut on the whole do you think that it would be\nfor the benefit of the men that the unions should be\nabolished P\u2014l think-it would be a benefit to the bese\nof the workmen.\nEarl _of Liebfield : Would it be a benefit to the\nmajority or to the minority ?\u2014The minority are the\nbest of the workmen.\n- -\n\nMr. Hughes: Therefore the abolition would\nbenefit the minority ?\u2014Perhaps one man about in\n-every ten would be above the average. If a master\nbricklayer was to give that man an extra 6d. the\nother men would make it out that he had given him\nthat extra 6d. to favour him, and then they would\ncome and demand it. There are plenty of cases in\nManchester in which some bricklayers are worth is.\na day more than the others.\nDo you think that if the unions were abolished\nfor the majority of men, the inferior workmen, the\nwages would fall P\u2014l certainly do think that if\ntrade societies were abolished they would fall, it is\nthe societies that have kept the wages up, although\ngood trade would raise wages at any time when\nthere is a scarcity of hands.\nBut do you think that the rise would come very\nquickly in that case ?It would not come so quickly\nas it does with the unions, because when one master\nhas to give more money to get men, the rest of the\nsociety men make a claim and of course they hav& a\nsociety at their back and they can do it better than\nindividual men can.\nYou do not think tlkat if the men were left to\nmake their, bargains as individuals with their\nmasters they, would get such high wages or so quick\na rise ?\u2014The best of the men would get the rise.\n_ _ _ .\n\nWe are speaking now of the majority P\u2014l do not\n\nthink they would get it so quick as with the society\nat their back.\nI think since Mr. Brarnall's death the busitreas\nhas heen carried on by his widow ?\u2014Yes, she is his\nsole executrix.\n\nAnd the unions have gone on to annoy her in the\nsame way as they annoyed him during his lifetime?\n\u2014The annoyance was all over before Mr. Bramalt\ndied.\nBut they interfere with her carrying on any other\nwork ?\u2014Ys, she had to give up all other trade, and\nMr. Bramall had also when he took the gaol on\naccount of using machine bricks.\nAnd that ban is still upon his window 9\u2014Yes, she\nhave neither joiners, bricklayers, nor hand-made\nbricks from club labour. The masons and plasterers\nnever had anything to do with it, nor subscribed that\nI know of. . .\n\n_\nChairman: What is the difference of cost in\nmachine-made brickwork as compared with the\nother ? Can you state what it is in a rod of nine-\ninch brickwork and that would give us a ratio ?\nThe shedule price orlour work is 2s. 3d. per yard,\nnine-inch work, and if it were hand-made bricks it\nwould be about 2s. 10d., then we should have to give\n19s. a 1,000 for them. The guarantee to\nBratnall was that the price of his bricks was 11\nper 1,000, and if he had had hand-made bricks the\nprice would be 19s, per 1,000, that is about 7d. dif-\nference in the yard of nine-inch brickwork.\nMr. Hughes: Do you think machine bricks much\nbetter than hand-made bricks 9\u2014There are some\nsorts of them that are very good. Platt's machine\nbricks are very good square bricks; they can lay\nthem a good deal better. We have used 8,000,000\nof Platt's bricks.\n\nYou think the extra pressure, perhaps, very ad-\nvantageous-40 tons on every brick one witness told\nus P\u2014Some say about 70.\nWhatever it is it must be very valuable P\u2014Yes.\nWe are building a chimney now, 226 feet high,\nwith about 1,003,000 of bricks in it, and fc.cin g it\nwith these pressed bricks of Platt's.\nMr. Roebuck: They are much harder than others,\nare they not P\u2014Yes.\nDid you ever hear of bricklayers making any\nobjection to use them because they were harder ?\nThey will not use them at all in Manchester. There\nis another matter I should like to refer to. The last\nwitness that came up spoke with regard to Thomas\nBarlow, who had to do with that murder of Jump,\nat Ashton. Barlow confessed, and just after the trial\nI had Barlow come to work on the same job where\nI was. About a dozen of the ;brickmakers belong-\ning to the Manchester society (I know one or two of\nthem by sight) came up to the job and wanted to\nknow if he were working there. I said he was, but\nwas not there that day, and they took and searched\neverywhere about the place to find Barlow. They\neven went in the office that I had put plans in, and\nlooked in the fire-place, and went to see if he had\nrun out into the road.\n\nDid you take no steps to punish those men for that\nact ?\u2014I was only foreman, just as I am now.\nDid your master take any steps P\u2014No.\nDid you complain to him P\u2014l told him that they\ncame up, but my idea was that they wanted to stop\nthe bricks.\n\nHad you any idea that it was an illegal proceed-\ning on their part P\u2014Of course I knew that it was\nillegal; I knew that they had ii. business to ooze\nand threaten anyone at the job.\n\nWho was your master then P\u2014Mr. Warburton.\nHe took no steps to punish them P\u2014No, he durst\nnot; if he did he must close all his other jobs.\nWe are to conclude then that he was under\ncoercion and error such as to compel him to allow\nan illegal offence to be committed without seeking\nto punish it P\u2014Yes ; if he had punished it they\nwould have stopped all his works.\nEarl of Lichfield : Was Barlow in any way con-\nnected with the management of any of these\nsocieties F--1 do not know; Barlow was a stranger\nto me altogether.\nMr. Roebuck: You know nothing of tra des'\nunions.?\u2014res, I was 19 years in one.\n\n(To be ,ocatinued.)\n\nTENDERS.\n\nFor girls' school and muter'a holm Tt 'Silva' Town, north\nWool ich.

The committee\nof the Lifeboat Society him aomplied with this request,\nand arrangements are accordingly being made to send\nto the palace a fully-equipped lifeboat, mounted on its\ntransporting carriage. A somewhat similar boat was\nexhibited in the Paris Universal Exhibition during the\npast summer.\nNARROW ESCAPE FROM ANOMER GREAT COALPIT Ex-\nPLOSION.\u2014A correspondent writes from Merthyr :\nOn Friday evening a most alarming accident occurred\nin the Aberewatboy Pit, in the Aberdare Valley, which\nnot only gave an idea of what a blower is,' but also\nshowed how terrible they are in their character, and\nhow, in all probability, they are the cause of most of\nour great explosions. Two hundred men were hard at\nwork when one of them struck into a fissure and in a\nmoment a strong current of gas burst forth that in an\nincredible space of time completely checked the ventila-\ntion. The men dew for their lives; one lame man\nnarrowly escaped suffocation, as he was not able to\nkeep pace with the rest. Happily no one was injured,\nand measures were at once taken to clear the workings\nof gas and restore the ventilation, Had this 'blower,'\nnot been discovered at the moment, or had there. been\none damaged lamp, all, or nearly all, of these two\nhundred men would have been sacrificed. No more\nstriking instance of the fact that awful calamities are at\nthe mercy of any man or boy in a pit has been given of\nlate years.\nSERIOUS ACCIDENT IN A FOUNDRY. TEN MEN\nBURNT.\u2014A large vessel containing about four tons of\nmolten metal was accidentally overturned on Saturday,\nat the moulding shop of Mr. Jonathan Edge, the Tip-\nping Ironworks, Bolton. Ten or twelve of the men were\nmore or less burnt, two of them seriously.\nFATAL ACCIDENT.\u2014On Monday John Finch, aged\n28, a carman, died at the Royal Free Hospital from in-\njuries received a few days ago.

I am perfectly con-\nvinced that the only way of effecting a peaceful\nchange in the laws relating to land in this country\nin our onward march to the ultimate good of making\nthe land national property must be through a\ntransition state. I would say in regard to the land\nlaws precisely the same as Mr. Fox says in his in-\ntroductory letter on currency reform, in alluding to\nthe adoption of a system of equitable exchanges,\n\"that the ultimate goal can only be reached by\nstages.\" I have no doubt but the first stage in land\nlaw reform must be through the transition state I\nhave indicated above.\n\nfeel constrained to come to this conclusion,\nbecause it is evidently too much to expect that a\npeople who have been educated into the belief\u2014\ntrained into the belief\u2014preached into the belief\u2014 ,\nand coerced into the belief\u2014that the landlords have\na divine right\u2014a prescriptive right\u2014and, in short,\nall manner of rights to a monopoly of private pro-\nperty in land. I say that I think it would be ex-\npecting too much for a people thus taught, trained,\nand habituated to be persuaded all at once to give\nup their long cherished views and notions, or have\nany correct appreciation of the incalculable benefits\nthat would accrue to the whole population by re-\nlieving them of the incubus and dead-weights of\nrack-reutism, consequent upon landlordism. When\nwe hear those from whom we expect better things\ndeclare that if the land was national property \"it\nwould make no difference in the amount of rent\nrequired of the tenant,\" we cannot expect the mul-\ntitude to be mach better acquainted with the objects,\ntendency, and general advantages that would be\nderived by the whole community from the land\nbecoming public property.\nThe real advanced thinkers and workers in this great\ncause must exercise great forbearance to well -meaning\nmen of this class, and permit without molestation\ntheir prejudices and their predilections to accompany\nthem quietly to the grave. It, however, belongs to\nthe rising generation--to the young and vigorous\nmanhood of England to teach and indoctrinate the\nyouth of our country, and enlighten their minds so\nas to produce united action in removing the errors of\npast legislation relating to land. All that is re-\nquired of those who have faith in the great prin-\nciple of man's natural and inalienable right of in-\nheritance on the soil is\u2014that they should go forth\nwith a singleness of purpose, and work energeti-\nsally \u2022 and as sure as to-morrow's sun will rise and\nsacce;ol the midnight gloom\u2014the light of calm\nand sincere reflection will enlighten their under-\nstandings, awaken their sagacity, and call forth their\nreasoning powers, when justice and intelligence will\neverywhere proclaim that our common mother earth\nought to be as free to our access as the air and light\nof heaven, or the waters of the ocean, and made\ninheritable to us all.\n\nIn the meantime let us render every assistance to\nenter the first stage or transition state on our\njourney when those who may wish to lag behind o\nremain stationary will discover they are only rest\ning at the half-way house, and will then have t\nfollow the pioneers and advocates of national pro-\nperty in land to their final destination. We may\nall join in breaking up the present land monopoly\nwithout in any way abandoning the nationalisation\nprinciple ; just as John Stuart Mill voted for house-\nbold suffrage without abandoning the advocacy of\nwhat some wise people are pleased to call his \"dream\"\nof female suffrage, but which appears, after\nall, to be awakening a good many very drowsy\npeople who have been slumbering all their\nlives with regard to this subject. Speaking of\n\"dreams,\" there WIS a certain naval engineer con-\nceived the idea and dreamt the \"dream\" of sending\nthe first steamship from the shores of England to\nAmerica; but the unbelievers, like others of the\n-same genus, se3ffed and predicted that the ship\nwould founder before she had been twenty-four\nhours at sea; but the vessel arrived safe notwith-\nstanding their gloomy forebodings. A still more\n\"dreamy\" idea to the sceptics was the \"dream\" of\nconnecting the Western with the Eastern world by\nan electric cable. The alliance of peoples and the\nestablishment of peace among civilized nations is\nalso considered a \"dream\" by the anchorites, who\nhave rso faith in anything, and those who live and\nhave their being by the fomentation of wars and\nstrife. But, somehow or other, two of the above-\nnamed \" dreams \" have become realities, and so\nwould the freedom of the soil, the establishment of\npeace and goodwill among men if it suited the land-\nlord and the monied interest to make them so.\n\nHowever, it would be better for the generality of\npeople even if they were occasionally \"dreaming\"\nabout these subjects than be moving about in a state\nof semi-somnambulism until they knock their heads\nagainst some prominent object or public question,\nwhieh they show they have never thought much\nabout, and are little acquainted with, and conse-\nquentlydiscourses about them in true stoical fashion.\nHitherto the money lords and the landlords have\nturned to their own advantage all mechanical and\nscientific inventions, and if all the entailed estates of\nthe United Kingdom were in the market for sale to-\nmorrow, the men with the money bags are the men\nthat would profit most by the trensaqtion. Thus\nthe land would, to a considerable extent, in due\ncourse, pass from the hands of the great landlords\nto the money lords, and to choose between the two\nclasses, the \"proud patrician\" is preferable to the\nastute and exacting \" Shylock\" who will have his\n\"bond,\" that is to 4ay, his interest and his rack-\nrent, or otherwise his \"pound of flesh,\" by which\nis meant the goods, the chattels, the estate and\neffects of all who might have the misfortune to come\nwithin his clutches and could not help themselves.\nYet, notwithstanding this unfavourable complexion\nof the subject, a\u2022 great point would be gained by\nabolishing the present huge monopoly in land, and\nenabling it to be freely bought, and sold, and con-\nveyed as easy and inexpensive as any other kind of\nproperty. Because, as soon as this can be accom-\nplished, there are thiee very powerful agents that\nwould then materially, assist the people to get a\nfirm hold upon the land during the transition state,\nnamely, co-operative production, which could then\nbe extended to agricultural pursuits, currency, and\ncredit -reform, and a truly comprehensive system of\nnational education. For the rest we may very fairly\ntrust to the future.\n\nI have alluded to currency reform becanVi\u2014inde\u2014r\nthe present Bank monopoly, the monetary power\nof England has a great deal more to do in strength-\nening and supporting the land monopoly than some\npeople have ever \" dreamt \" of in their philosophy.\nThis reminds me of a correspondence I lately had\nwith a gentleman who has some inclination to be a\nland-law reformer, if he only knew how ; and who\nalso has certain misgivings about the justice and\nsoundness of our currency laws, and yet declared\nthat he \"would not permit a single note to be issued\nwithout a sovereign to back it.\" - Upon reading this\ndeclaration I began to feel some anxiety as to\nwhether he had any friends or not, because, if he\nhas, the Soon.er they look after him the better.\nPoliticians in swaddling cloths decidedly require\nlooking after, and as there is some promise of better\nthings coming from this gentleman in future, I\nstrong recommend him and all those answering the\nsame type, to place themselves under the care of\nproper tutors and guardians as soon as possible.\nIf any further proof were wanted of the connec-\ntion between the landed and the monied power,\nand the use that is made of the Bank nionopoly by\nthe Government of the day, we have it in the fact\nthat the present Government of landlords, after\nhaving commenced a foreign war during the Parlia-\nmentary vacation, go to the Br.nlc of England; which\nis the State banker, the Issue Department being\nplaced under their control by law, by which they\ncan dip.their hands into the coffers of the Bank and\ntake out the \u00a32,000,000 they require to commence\nthe Abyssinian War. and put on an income-tax to\n\nRUPTURES.

J. Woods, coroner for the western division of\nSurrey, at the Percy Arms Inn. The room in which\nthe inquiry was conducted, and which was situate atout\na quarter of a mile from the powder mills, was a long\napartment, furnished with numerous windows, all of\nwhich had been demolished by the explosion. The\nCoroner said that in this inquiry it would be neces-\nsary to ascertain not merely the cluse of death, but\nalso whether the machinery employed at the powder\nmills was proper for the particular manufacture,\nand, whether due precautions were taken for the\nprevention of accidents: His pra sent intention was\nmerely to open the inqulry and then adjourn it. After\nthe jury had seen the bodies and the scene of the ex-\nplosion, the following evidence was taken :\u2014Jare e 3\nWilliam Upfold, foreman of Mr. Share's gi,nnowder\nworks, said he last saw the deceased alive about 10\nminutes past 11 o'clock on Friday morn:ng, when tiny\nwere both standing at the door of the press-house\npress-house frem 7 o'clock on Friday morning, raid\ntalking to him. They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found. Mansell\nhad been employed upon the works for the past two\nyears, and Farnfield almost from his infancy. The\nmachinery in the press-room was new except the by-\ndraulic press, which had been in work about seven ye irs.\nWhen the witness EitNY the deceased at the door of the\npress-house both bad on their working dress. At this\nstage of the proceedings the inquiry was adjourned, and\nit was resolved that in the meantime the Board of Trade\nAhould be requested to send a competent person imme_\ndiately to inspect the scene of the accident.\n\nOUR MINERAL WEALTH.\u2014 1 hrough the courtesy of\nour esteemed correspondent, Mr. Robert Hunt, F,R.S.,\nthe Keeper of Mining Records at the Royal School of\nMines, we have been favoured with the statistics of our\nmineral production for 1863, which will be issued to\nthe public in a week or ten days from this time. The\nvalue of the minerals produced was \u00a329,151,976, from\nwhich metals of the value of \u00a336,364,327 were extracted.\nOf gold quartz we produced 385 tons, worth \u00a31,500; of\ntin ore, 15,157 tons, worth \u00a3963,985; of copper ore,\n212,947 tons, worth t,100,554; of lead ore, 91,283\ntons, worth \u00a31,193,530 ; of silver ore, 38 ton., worth\n\u00a35,703; and of zinc ore, 1,941 tons, worth \u00a329,968.\nDuring the year in question there were sold 95,376\ntons of pyrites, for \u00a362,035; and the rarer mimnils\u2014\nwolfram, uranium, gossans,\nof\nn.c, and earthy minera's\nraised were of the value ot \u00a31,980,866. Th se items, i\nwith the value of 9,101,552 tons of ron ore, \u00a33,240,890,\nand 86,292 215 tons of coal, \u00a320,572,945, raises the\ntotal to \u00a329,151,976, which was manufactured into\nnearly \u00a340,000,000 of merchantable produce. To pro-\nduce these results direct employment has been given to\nat least 500,000 men, so that our mineral industries may\nbe considered as alone supportipg a population of nearly\n3,000,000, in addition to adding !much to the general\nwealth of the kingdom, and especially to the wealth of\nthose whose capital has been employed in mining ope-\nrations.\u2014Afinirq Journal.\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO A CHILD AT A RAILWAY STA-\nTION.--A frightful accident has occurred to Frederick\nPacker, a boy 11 years of age, at the New-cross station\nof the Brighton Railway. It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally. This com-\npany paid \u00a38,351 as compsnsation for personal injui\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BATH.\u2014The Queen has been\ngraciously pleased to give orders for the following\nappointments to the Most Honounble Order of the\nBath.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep.

Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife. If Johnson's wife had lived there\nwould have been no hoarding up of bits of orange-peel;\nno touching all the, posts in walking along the street;\nno eating and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If\nOliver Goldsmith had been married he would never\nhave worn that memorable and ridiculous coat. When-\never you find a man whom you know little about oddly\ndressed, or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any\neccentricity of manner, you may be tolerably sure that\nhe is not a married man. For the little corners are\nrounded off, the little shoots ate pruned away, in\nmarried men. Wives generally have much more sense\nthan their husbands, especially when the husbands are\nclever men.

J. Woods, coroner for the western division of\nSurrey, at the Percy Arms Inn. The room in which\nthe inquiry was conducted, and which was situate atout\na quarter of a mile from the powder mills, was a long\napartment, furnished with numerous windows, all of\nwhich had been demolished by the explosion. The\nCoroner said that in this inquiry it would be neces-\nsary to ascertain not merely the cluse of death, but\nalso whether the machinery employed at the powder\nmills was proper for the particular manufacture,\nand, whether due precautions were taken for the\nprevention of accidents: His pra sent intention was\nmerely to open the inqulry and then adjourn it. After\nthe jury had seen the bodies and the scene of the ex-\nplosion, the following evidence was taken :\u2014Jare e 3\nWilliam Upfold, foreman of Mr. Share's gi,nnowder\nworks, said he last saw the deceased alive about 10\nminutes past 11 o'clock on Friday morn:ng, when tiny\nwere both standing at the door of the press-house\npress-house frem 7 o'clock on Friday morning, raid\ntalking to him. They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found. Mansell\nhad been employed upon the works for the past two\nyears, and Farnfield almost from his infancy. The\nmachinery in the press-room was new except the by-\ndraulic press, which had been in work about seven ye irs.\nWhen the witness EitNY the deceased at the door of the\npress-house both bad on their working dress. At this\nstage of the proceedings the inquiry was adjourned, and\nit was resolved that in the meantime the Board of Trade\nAhould be requested to send a competent person imme_\ndiately to inspect the scene of the accident.\n\nOUR MINERAL WEALTH.\u2014 1 hrough the courtesy of\nour esteemed correspondent, Mr. Robert Hunt, F,R.S.,\nthe Keeper of Mining Records at the Royal School of\nMines, we have been favoured with the statistics of our\nmineral production for 1863, which will be issued to\nthe public in a week or ten days from this time. The\nvalue of the minerals produced was \u00a329,151,976, from\nwhich metals of the value of \u00a336,364,327 were extracted.\nOf gold quartz we produced 385 tons, worth \u00a31,500; of\ntin ore, 15,157 tons, worth \u00a3963,985; of copper ore,\n212,947 tons, worth t,100,554; of lead ore, 91,283\ntons, worth \u00a31,193,530 ; of silver ore, 38 ton., worth\n\u00a35,703; and of zinc ore, 1,941 tons, worth \u00a329,968.\nDuring the year in question there were sold 95,376\ntons of pyrites, for \u00a362,035; and the rarer mimnils\u2014\nwolfram, uranium, gossans,\nof\nn.c, and earthy minera's\nraised were of the value ot \u00a31,980,866. Th se items, i\nwith the value of 9,101,552 tons of ron ore, \u00a33,240,890,\nand 86,292 215 tons of coal, \u00a320,572,945, raises the\ntotal to \u00a329,151,976, which was manufactured into\nnearly \u00a340,000,000 of merchantable produce. To pro-\nduce these results direct employment has been given to\nat least 500,000 men, so that our mineral industries may\nbe considered as alone supportipg a population of nearly\n3,000,000, in addition to adding !much to the general\nwealth of the kingdom, and especially to the wealth of\nthose whose capital has been employed in mining ope-\nrations.\u2014Afinirq Journal.\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO A CHILD AT A RAILWAY STA-\nTION.--A frightful accident has occurred to Frederick\nPacker, a boy 11 years of age, at the New-cross station\nof the Brighton Railway. It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally. This com-\npany paid \u00a38,351 as compsnsation for personal injui\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BATH.\u2014The Queen has been\ngraciously pleased to give orders for the following\nappointments to the Most Honounble Order of the\nBath.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep. These\npowders were to be tatters in preserves' and on Tuesday\nmorning, the nurse having prrpared one for Mrs.\nRawlin, in order to give it to her as soon as she awoke\n(she was then sleeping with the child by her side)' left\n, the room. On her rcturn, Mrs. Rawlin told her that\nthe child had been out of bed and eaten \"the goody.\"\nHe was then snoring loudly, and although she tried to\nrouse him she could not, and he shortly afterwards died.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death.\"\u2014\nWeeeli:ld Journal.\nTHE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT MONT-\nGOLFIER BALLOON. Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife. If Johnson's wife had lived there\nwould have been no hoarding up of bits of orange-peel;\nno touching all the, posts in walking along the street;\nno eating and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If\nOliver Goldsmith had been married he would never\nhave worn that memorable and ridiculous coat. When-\never you find a man whom you know little about oddly\ndressed, or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any\neccentricity of manner, you may be tolerably sure that\nhe is not a married man. For the little corners are\nrounded off, the little shoots ate pruned away, in\nmarried men. Wives generally have much more sense\nthan their husbands, especially when the husbands are\nclever men. The wive's advices are like the ballast\nthat keeps the ship steady.

After\nthe jury had seen the bodies and the scene of the ex-\nplosion, the following evidence was taken :\u2014Jare e 3\nWilliam Upfold, foreman of Mr. Share's gi,nnowder\nworks, said he last saw the deceased alive about 10\nminutes past 11 o'clock on Friday morn:ng, when tiny\nwere both standing at the door of the press-house\npress-house frem 7 o'clock on Friday morning, raid\ntalking to him. They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found. Mansell\nhad been employed upon the works for the past two\nyears, and Farnfield almost from his infancy. The\nmachinery in the press-room was new except the by-\ndraulic press, which had been in work about seven ye irs.\nWhen the witness EitNY the deceased at the door of the\npress-house both bad on their working dress. At this\nstage of the proceedings the inquiry was adjourned, and\nit was resolved that in the meantime the Board of Trade\nAhould be requested to send a competent person imme_\ndiately to inspect the scene of the accident.\n\nOUR MINERAL WEALTH.\u2014 1 hrough the courtesy of\nour esteemed correspondent, Mr. Robert Hunt, F,R.S.,\nthe Keeper of Mining Records at the Royal School of\nMines, we have been favoured with the statistics of our\nmineral production for 1863, which will be issued to\nthe public in a week or ten days from this time. The\nvalue of the minerals produced was \u00a329,151,976, from\nwhich metals of the value of \u00a336,364,327 were extracted.\nOf gold quartz we produced 385 tons, worth \u00a31,500; of\ntin ore, 15,157 tons, worth \u00a3963,985; of copper ore,\n212,947 tons, worth t,100,554; of lead ore, 91,283\ntons, worth \u00a31,193,530 ; of silver ore, 38 ton., worth\n\u00a35,703; and of zinc ore, 1,941 tons, worth \u00a329,968.\nDuring the year in question there were sold 95,376\ntons of pyrites, for \u00a362,035; and the rarer mimnils\u2014\nwolfram, uranium, gossans,\nof\nn.c, and earthy minera's\nraised were of the value ot \u00a31,980,866. Th se items, i\nwith the value of 9,101,552 tons of ron ore, \u00a33,240,890,\nand 86,292 215 tons of coal, \u00a320,572,945, raises the\ntotal to \u00a329,151,976, which was manufactured into\nnearly \u00a340,000,000 of merchantable produce. To pro-\nduce these results direct employment has been given to\nat least 500,000 men, so that our mineral industries may\nbe considered as alone supportipg a population of nearly\n3,000,000, in addition to adding !much to the general\nwealth of the kingdom, and especially to the wealth of\nthose whose capital has been employed in mining ope-\nrations.\u2014Afinirq Journal.\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO A CHILD AT A RAILWAY STA-\nTION.--A frightful accident has occurred to Frederick\nPacker, a boy 11 years of age, at the New-cross station\nof the Brighton Railway. It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally. This com-\npany paid \u00a38,351 as compsnsation for personal injui\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BATH.\u2014The Queen has been\ngraciously pleased to give orders for the following\nappointments to the Most Honounble Order of the\nBath.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep. These\npowders were to be tatters in preserves' and on Tuesday\nmorning, the nurse having prrpared one for Mrs.\nRawlin, in order to give it to her as soon as she awoke\n(she was then sleeping with the child by her side)' left\n, the room. On her rcturn, Mrs. Rawlin told her that\nthe child had been out of bed and eaten \"the goody.\"\nHe was then snoring loudly, and although she tried to\nrouse him she could not, and he shortly afterwards died.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death.\"\u2014\nWeeeli:ld Journal.\nTHE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT MONT-\nGOLFIER BALLOON. Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife.

Mr. Thomas Ricketts,\nfarmer, said on, Sunday evening he was walking in his\nfields,, in company with his uncle (deceased), and saw\ntwo men in a field leading to. Northend: His little\nterrier deg ran towards them, but did not attempt to\nbite them; but one made use of foul words, and witness\ntold them to. go on. C. Beare aiked witness what he\nhad to do.with it, to which he replied that he was the\nparish constable and owner of the field, and would have.\nthem taken up for being drunk and disorderly. Charles..\ntook off his coat, and. was going to strike witness,.\nbut was. held back by the. other, who exclaimed, \"No,\nyou shan't rtrike.\" But Charles being the stronger,\ngot away from him, and, struck witness on the\nside of his head with, his clenched fist. Deceased'\nbeing lame, carried a stick, and witness took it from\nhim,. and knocked his. assailant down. They had a\nstruggle, and in the. end the stick broke.

About five or six yards from\nwhere he saw them he found deceased lying on his left\nside in a furrow. His face was covered with blood, and,\nin reply to witness, said he was very much hurt, and\nthat he begged and prayed \"them\" or \"him,\" he could\nnot say which, not to hurt him. The constable who\napprehended the prisoners said when he did so he took\nthem to Mr. Rickett's house, and deceased, pointing to\nCharles, said, \"It is the stiff one that kicked me.\" On\nthe way to the lock-up, Richard said to Charles, \"Well,\nI have said nothing about it, but now I will speak.\nYou know, Charles, if you had been ruled by me, you\nwould not have kicked the old man, and then we should\nnot have been here.\" Charles replied, \"I know that.\"\nThe coroner's jury returned a verdict of wilful murder\nagainst Charles Beare, with a special finding' giving the\nbrother the benefit of the doubt.

The same number of deaths are\nattributable to accidents at coalpiti ; one of which, that\nof a man named Mears, wan caused by a fall of roof at\nBarley Brook colliery; another, of Lawrence Scatty, by\nbeing crushed between two waggons at the Middle\nPatricroft Pit; and the remaining accident befel a boy,\nnamed Baldwin, killed by falling from a trambridge\ninto a brook and pull ng upon himself a waggon laden\nwith coals which he was taking down an incline.

J. Woods, coroner for the western division of\nSurrey, at the Percy Arms Inn. The room in which\nthe inquiry was conducted, and which was situate atout\na quarter of a mile from the powder mills, was a long\napartment, furnished with numerous windows, all of\nwhich had been demolished by the explosion. The\nCoroner said that in this inquiry it would be neces-\nsary to ascertain not merely the cluse of death, but\nalso whether the machinery employed at the powder\nmills was proper for the particular manufacture,\nand, whether due precautions were taken for the\nprevention of accidents: His pra sent intention was\nmerely to open the inqulry and then adjourn it. After\nthe jury had seen the bodies and the scene of the ex-\nplosion, the following evidence was taken :\u2014Jare e 3\nWilliam Upfold, foreman of Mr. Share's gi,nnowder\nworks, said he last saw the deceased alive about 10\nminutes past 11 o'clock on Friday morn:ng, when tiny\nwere both standing at the door of the press-house\npress-house frem 7 o'clock on Friday morning, raid\ntalking to him. They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found. Mansell\nhad been employed upon the works for the past two\nyears, and Farnfield almost from his infancy. The\nmachinery in the press-room was new except the by-\ndraulic press, which had been in work about seven ye irs.\nWhen the witness EitNY the deceased at the door of the\npress-house both bad on their working dress. At this\nstage of the proceedings the inquiry was adjourned, and\nit was resolved that in the meantime the Board of Trade\nAhould be requested to send a competent person imme_\ndiately to inspect the scene of the accident.\n\nOUR MINERAL WEALTH.\u2014 1 hrough the courtesy of\nour esteemed correspondent, Mr. Robert Hunt, F,R.S.,\nthe Keeper of Mining Records at the Royal School of\nMines, we have been favoured with the statistics of our\nmineral production for 1863, which will be issued to\nthe public in a week or ten days from this time. The\nvalue of the minerals produced was \u00a329,151,976, from\nwhich metals of the value of \u00a336,364,327 were extracted.\nOf gold quartz we produced 385 tons, worth \u00a31,500; of\ntin ore, 15,157 tons, worth \u00a3963,985; of copper ore,\n212,947 tons, worth t,100,554; of lead ore, 91,283\ntons, worth \u00a31,193,530 ; of silver ore, 38 ton., worth\n\u00a35,703; and of zinc ore, 1,941 tons, worth \u00a329,968.\nDuring the year in question there were sold 95,376\ntons of pyrites, for \u00a362,035; and the rarer mimnils\u2014\nwolfram, uranium, gossans,\nof\nn.c, and earthy minera's\nraised were of the value ot \u00a31,980,866. Th se items, i\nwith the value of 9,101,552 tons of ron ore, \u00a33,240,890,\nand 86,292 215 tons of coal, \u00a320,572,945, raises the\ntotal to \u00a329,151,976, which was manufactured into\nnearly \u00a340,000,000 of merchantable produce. To pro-\nduce these results direct employment has been given to\nat least 500,000 men, so that our mineral industries may\nbe considered as alone supportipg a population of nearly\n3,000,000, in addition to adding !much to the general\nwealth of the kingdom, and especially to the wealth of\nthose whose capital has been employed in mining ope-\nrations.\u2014Afinirq Journal.\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO A CHILD AT A RAILWAY STA-\nTION.--A frightful accident has occurred to Frederick\nPacker, a boy 11 years of age, at the New-cross station\nof the Brighton Railway. It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally. This com-\npany paid \u00a38,351 as compsnsation for personal injui\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BATH.\u2014The Queen has been\ngraciously pleased to give orders for the following\nappointments to the Most Honounble Order of the\nBath.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep. These\npowders were to be tatters in preserves' and on Tuesday\nmorning, the nurse having prrpared one for Mrs.\nRawlin, in order to give it to her as soon as she awoke\n(she was then sleeping with the child by her side)' left\n, the room. On her rcturn, Mrs. Rawlin told her that\nthe child had been out of bed and eaten \"the goody.\"\nHe was then snoring loudly, and although she tried to\nrouse him she could not, and he shortly afterwards died.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death.\"\u2014\nWeeeli:ld Journal.\nTHE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT MONT-\nGOLFIER BALLOON. Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife. If Johnson's wife had lived there\nwould have been no hoarding up of bits of orange-peel;\nno touching all the, posts in walking along the street;\nno eating and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If\nOliver Goldsmith had been married he would never\nhave worn that memorable and ridiculous coat. When-\never you find a man whom you know little about oddly\ndressed, or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any\neccentricity of manner, you may be tolerably sure that\nhe is not a married man. For the little corners are\nrounded off, the little shoots ate pruned away, in\nmarried men. Wives generally have much more sense\nthan their husbands, especially when the husbands are\nclever men.

Mr. Beard, solicitor, appeared\nfor the defence. On the night of Monday, the 19th,\nabout eight o'clock, the little girl, who is seriously in-\njured, was crossing the City-road, when a horse, which\nwas attached to a cab driven by the defendant, struck\nher and she fell to the ground. _ Before, she could be\npicked up the wheels of the cab passed over her. The tie-,\nfendant drove on as if nothing had happened, and would\nhave got away had it not been for a gentleman, who\nstopped the cab, put the child inside, and told the defen- ,\ndant to drive to the nearest hospital. Instead of doingoo,\nhe drove to the King's-crossroad Police-station, where\nhe was found to be so drunk, that he was quite unfit to\ntake charge of the cab and he was detained in custody.\nThe child was taken to the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's-\ninn-road, where it was found .by the house-surgeon\nto be badly injured. Mr. Beard said that Mr. Oakley, 1\nthe defendant's employer, had made ample compensa-\ntion to the parents of the child, who was progressing\nvery favourably, and, therefore, he hoped the magi-\nstrate would dismiss the charge.

Great\nexception has been taken of late years at the oonduct\nof these fetes. Beginning with a fancy fair, aided by\na few entertainments of a comic character, supported\nby a half-dozen of .the most original and amusing\nperformers on the stage, it had yearly increased its\nproportions until it had, assumed the character of a,\ntheatrical saturnalia. The council this year pro-\nduced an entertainment of an entirely different de-\nscription, but the programme was anything but satis.,\nfactory. It consisted of selections from favourite\nplays performed by members of most of the principal\ntheatres. Had this performance taken piece upon the..\nstage of one of our large theatres, as has been done\nfor the benefit of the family of some favourite actor,\nit would have been a great success; as it was, it was\nsimply absurd. It took place upon the great stage.\nIn front of this were five shilling seats, behind and\nbeyond. these were the half-crown seats, while the one\nshilling seats were in the great orchestra. It is need-\nless to say that actors, who properly speak but little\nabove the ordinary pitch of the voice, were utterly'\ninaudible to all except those in the few front rows of\nthe five ehilling seats. Had all the visitors been\nseated, that is, had the silence been nearly perfect, the\nvoices might have penetrated farther, but the reserved\nseat tickets were all sold at an early hour of the after-\nnoon, and the promenading of the great numbers who\nwere unable to find seats kept up a continual murmur\nwhich was fatal to all chance of hearing.

The complainant was Mr. Edwards\nWoods, the solicitor who has taken a prominent part\nin the Abergele prosecutions, and the defendant was\nGeorge Grinnett, signalman at the Holy-well station\non the London and North Western Railway. The\noffence charged as stated in the summons was that the\ndefendant did unlawfully, wilfully, and negligently\nomit to do a certain act\u2014to wit, to put up the sema-\nphore signal danger to show that the lino was not clear\nat Holywell station at the time the express train leav-\ning Chester at 2.45 p.m. was due to pass through, at\nwhich time a goods train was standing on the down\nline, causing the express to run into collision with the\ngoods train, whereby the life and limbs of Mr.\nEdwards Woods, and the life and limbs of other pas-\nsengers, were endangered. Mr. Woods said the com-\nplaint which the bench would be asked to hear was\npreferred by himself against the defendant, who was a\nsignalman at Holywell station on the 16th day of\nSeptember. The proceedings were taken under the\n3rd and 4th Vic., cap. 97, sec. 13. Mr. Woods having\ndescribed in detail the accident and the injuries which\nhe alleged himself to have sustained, Mr. Ellis Eyton\nproceeded to cross-examine him. In reply to various\nquestions, Mr. Woods said\u2014l hardly remember what\ntrain I went down to Holywell by on the morning of\nthe accident. I think I went down by the noon train,\nbut lam not sure. I am certain I was in the train\nwhen the accident happened. The first step I took\nwas to summon the station=master, Mr. Jones. I did\nnot obtain the summons in this court. What I did\nwas under the advice of Mr. Lenge, the magistrates'\nclerk at Rhyl. I .entirely disclaim any personal\nmotives in this prosecution. After the accident I went\non to Rhyl, and telegraphed an account of it to the\nTimes newspaper and the Daily Telegraph. I wrote\nanother letter to the Times enclosing a letter, which\nhad been forwarded to me praising me for my conduct\nin the Abergele case. Mr. Eyton was proceeding ta\ncross-examine Mr. Woods as to-his doings at Abergele,\nbut this line of cross-examination was objected to.\nMr. Edwards Woods called Mr. Jones, station-master\nat Holywell, who cited a rule of the company's service\nwith reference to the proper working of signals, and\nMr. Stretton, inspector of police upon the line, proved\nthat he had supplied the defendant with a copy of the\nrules. Mr. Hughes, who temporarily filled the office of\nstation-master at Holywell during the absence of 7sfr.\nJones, who was on his holiday at the time of the acci-\ndent, stated that the semaphore signal was up. two\nminutes before the express was due. The down line\nwas not clear at the time the 2.40 p.m. train arrived,\nand a collision occurred. Cross-examined.\u2014The 2.40\ntrain id not timed to stop at Holywell, but as a matter\nof fact it had stopped for some time previously for the\npurpose of taking water. On an average it stops at\nHolywell two or three times a week. I was standing\nin the middle of the platform when the expret;i passed\nthrough, and the trucks which were being shunted,\nand with which the express came into collision, stood\nabout 200 yards further on. When the express passed\nme it was going at the rate of about 12 miles an hour.\nThe guards were applying the breaks hard, and by the\ntime the train reached the trucks the speed was re-\nduced by one-half. I went up to the carriages upon\nthe accident taking place, but did not find anyone hurt.\nNone of the passengers complained to me of injuries.\nI do not know whether I saw the complainant there.\nI think I did. John Naylor, engine driver of the ex-\npress' said\u2014When I approached Holywell I saw that\nboth the distance signal and the semaphore were at\ndanger. I saw them about a mile off. On seeing the\ndistance signal I shut off steam and prepared to stop\nthe train. I whistled and both signals were lowered\nas a sign that all was right. I had not then reached\nthe distance signal. I thereupon put on steam and\nproceeded. The train was not timed to stop at Holy-\nwell. When I got inside the station I saw a person\nwaving his hands to me to stop. I then shut off steam\nand reversed the engine, and did all I could to stop.\nAt this time I was going at the rate of 30 miles an\nhour. The semaphore signal was down at this moment.\nI am sure of that, for when I saw the hand waving,\nI looked up to the signal. I did not see any portion\nof the obstructing train till I got close up to it. I\nsaw that one portion of the goods train was on the up-.\nline, and the other on the down. I ran into them\nbroadside. The goods train was going tow&\nChester, and the driver had drawn it on to the up-line\nas far as he could get, but there was a passenger train\nbefore him, and hi l train was so long that three of the\ntrucks were left on the 'down line in the way of my\ntrain. I got on the step of the engine and dropped oil\njust before the collision took place. I was going at\nthe rate of about 15 miles an hour when the shock oc-\ncurred. This was the case for the plaintiff. For the\ndefence it was urged that the accident was the result\nof an error of judgment on the part of the defendant,\nand not of wilful negligence as provided for by the\nstatute. The Chairman dwelt upon the importance of\nthe signalman's duties, and to mark their sense of the\nheinousness of the prisoner's offence, the bench sen-\ntenced him to two months' imprisonment, the longest\nterm the law permitted them to' inflict.\n","127940":"TWO HUNDRED AND TWO LIVES LOST.\n\nA dreadful calamity occurred on Monday at Ply-\nmouth, in Pennsylvania, in the coal region of A. von-\ndale.

The proportion is\nincreasing; the deaths by violence in 10,003 of p )pul s-\ndon ranged from 7.16 to 7.60 in the four years 1851-51 ;\nfrom 7.95 to 8.35 in the four years 1861-67. There is\nno increase of death from murder, manslaughter, or\nsuicide, but in the deaths from accident or negligence\nthe increase is too manifest. In the five years 1863-67\n2,391,165 deaths were registered in England and Wales,\nwith the causes of death specified ; and of 83,853, the deaths\nof 62,708 males and 21,143 females, were violent deaths.\nIt must also be stated that 498 of these males and 123 of the\nfemales were intoxicated when the accident or other violence\nwhich proved fatal occurred to them. 4,175 of these violent\ndeaths were by railway accidents; 5,898 by accidents in\nor about mines; 28,114 by mechanical in.] urie4, such as\nfractures, falls' or being run over; 14,921 by chymical '\nirjuries, such as burns scalds, poisoning; 23,823 by\nasphyxia or suspension of respiration chiefly by drowning\nor suffocation; 6,896 by violence not particularly de-\nscribed. The whole number is equal to the popula-\ntion of a large city, such as Norwich; 19,510 of these\nviolent deaths, not very far from a fourth of the whole\nnumber, were deaths of children under 5 years of age;\n3,933 children were burnt to death, 3,267 scalded to\ndeath, 1,950 drowned, 5,134 suffocated; so difficult is the\nentrance upon life' 6,696 of the violent deaths were suicides\n\u20141,905 males, 1791 females; 21 boys and 15 girls under 15\nyears old committed suicide, most of the boys by hang-\ning and most of the girls by drowning\u2014one girl who\ndrowned herself was under 5 years of age; 130 lads and\n165 girls between 15 and 20 committed suicide; 252 young\nmen and 163 young women between 20 and 25; 664\nmen and 272 women between 25 and 35 ; 9 l 9 men and 330\nwomen between 35 and 45; 1,135 men and 382 women\nbetween 45 and 55; 1,066 men and 261 women between\n55 and 66; 688 men and 203 women above 65.

The wise work for both\n\u2014for the future in the present, and for the present in\nthe future.\n\nVicious habits are so great a strain to human nature,\nand so odious in themselves, that every person. ac-\ntuated by right reason would avoid them, though he\nwere sure they would be always concealed, both from\nGod and man, and had no future punishment entailed\nupon them.\nIMPROVEMENT IN LOCOMOTIVE ENGINES.\u2014If we\nreview the course of locomotive improvement during\nthe 30 years intervening between 1833 and 1868, we\nshall find that the main features of the machine re-\nmain with little alteration, and that the principal\nchanges have been an augmentation in the size of\nthe engines, and the introduction of certain structural\nameliorations in the details. The traffic on the rail-\nways has, during this time, greatly increased, and not\nonly are there more frequent trains, but there are\nmore passengers and goods presenting themselves to\nbe transported by each train ; so that the weight of\nthe trains has increased as well as their number, and\nthis progression is still going on. Then it has been\nfound to be cheaper to transport a given weight of\nnumbermerchandise\ng ihnt ones fw\nof the locomotive has been gradually growing until\nwe have some goods engines weighing about GO tons.\nThe objection to such very heavy engines is that they\ne s\no heavy\nthat tirhaei ns p thanowe r d a\nweight t\nare very severe upon the permanent way, and it\nwould indeed be greatly preferable to employ two\ndistinct engines, with their fire-boxes brought to\nthe same tender, as recommended by me to be done\nin the first edition of my former \"Treatise on the\nSteam Engine,\" published in the year 1845. If at a\nspeed of 60 miles an hour we take the resistance at\n301 b. per ton, then a train weighing, with engine and\ntender, 200 tons, will require a tractive force of\n6,000 lb. to draw it even on a level; and if the gradi-\nents be at the same time steep, it is easy to see that\nthe locomotive must necessarily be both powerful and\nheavy which has to fulfil the prescribed conditions.\nIn every way difficulties present themselves to the\ngeneration of a very large power in a single engine.\nThe utmost diameter of the barrel of the boiler that\ncan be got between the wheels of a passenger engine\nin a narrow-gauge lines 4 feet 2 inches; and in such\na diameter it is impossible, if the power be large, to\nget the necessary colorimeter or tube area to transmit\nthe smoke without the use of so powerful a blast as\nwill consume a large part of the engine-power by the\nback-pressure it throws upon the piston. There is a\nsimilar difficulty with the heating surface. In some\ncases the barrel of the boiler has been made oval, to\nenable more tubes to be got in; and, in the case of\nsome\ned oouf btht\nebFer\nepnrcohj ecgteodo d\nsb.eeynogin\nnd\nest hi\nte\niswheels, 5\ngoods engines with very small wheels, the barrel may\nand\nfeet n\ndiameter.

The room in which\nthe inquiry was conducted, and which was situate atout\na quarter of a mile from the powder mills, was a long\napartment, furnished with numerous windows, all of\nwhich had been demolished by the explosion. The\nCoroner said that in this inquiry it would be neces-\nsary to ascertain not merely the cluse of death, but\nalso whether the machinery employed at the powder\nmills was proper for the particular manufacture,\nand, whether due precautions were taken for the\nprevention of accidents: His pra sent intention was\nmerely to open the inqulry and then adjourn it. After\nthe jury had seen the bodies and the scene of the ex-\nplosion, the following evidence was taken :\u2014Jare e 3\nWilliam Upfold, foreman of Mr. Share's gi,nnowder\nworks, said he last saw the deceased alive about 10\nminutes past 11 o'clock on Friday morn:ng, when tiny\nwere both standing at the door of the press-house\npress-house frem 7 o'clock on Friday morning, raid\ntalking to him. They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found.

It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally. This com-\npany paid \u00a38,351 as compsnsation for personal injui\n\nTHE ORDER OF THE BATH.\u2014The Queen has been\ngraciously pleased to give orders for the following\nappointments to the Most Honounble Order of the\nBath.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep. These\npowders were to be tatters in preserves' and on Tuesday\nmorning, the nurse having prrpared one for Mrs.\nRawlin, in order to give it to her as soon as she awoke\n(she was then sleeping with the child by her side)' left\n, the room. On her rcturn, Mrs. Rawlin told her that\nthe child had been out of bed and eaten \"the goody.\"\nHe was then snoring loudly, and although she tried to\nrouse him she could not, and he shortly afterwards died.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death.\"\u2014\nWeeeli:ld Journal.\nTHE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT MONT-\nGOLFIER BALLOON. Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife. If Johnson's wife had lived there\nwould have been no hoarding up of bits of orange-peel;\nno touching all the, posts in walking along the street;\nno eating and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If\nOliver Goldsmith had been married he would never\nhave worn that memorable and ridiculous coat. When-\never you find a man whom you know little about oddly\ndressed, or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any\neccentricity of manner, you may be tolerably sure that\nhe is not a married man. For the little corners are\nrounded off, the little shoots ate pruned away, in\nmarried men. Wives generally have much more sense\nthan their husbands, especially when the husbands are\nclever men.

The train which left Becilington\nby this branch for North Seaton at a quarter past 8 in\nthe morning, was proceeding to the. latter place, when\nthe engineman descried a coal train, apparently coming\nup from the pits.

Hills, the coroner for Chatham, has concluded\nan investigation into the circumstances connected with\nthe recent shocking accident which occurred in the\nfoundry at Chatham Dockyard, by which Charles\nCrossland, one of the workmen, lost his life in a most\nhorrible manner. From the evidence of the witnesses\nexamined it appeared that at the time of the accident\nthe workmen, between 30 and 40 in number,, were\nengaged casting the large brass cleaver, weighing seven\ntons, to be placed in front of the stem of the Lord\nWarden ironclad frigate. The whole of the molten\nmetal had been run into the mould, when the sides\nsuddenly gave way, scattering the liquid metal in all\ndirections. The deceased, who was standing in an\nelevated place, jumped down and attempted to run\naway, when a large quantity of the hot metal fell in a\nshower on him, inflicting most horrible injuries, of\nwhich, after lingering. about 24 hours, he died. The\ncoroner and jury instituted a searching investigation\ninto the character and strength of the mould, when all\nthe witnesses were unanimous in expressing their\nopinion that it was constructed of extra strength, and\nwith all possible care, and that the accident was, in\nfact, inexplicable. It was also stated that it would\noccupy about six weeks to construct another mould. It\n' appeared to be a marvel that there were not more lives\nsacrificed, as there were several ladies and other\nspectators present witnessing the operation. The jury,\nafter a lengthened investigation, returned a verdict of\n\"Accidental death,\" intimating, at the same time, that\nall possible care had been taken in the construction of\nthc mould.\n","400564":"NEW COUPLING FOIL RAILWAY\n\nCARRIAGES.\n\nThe object of this contrivance, which consists of a\nmodification of the ordinary coupling, is to cut off the\nconnection between the engine and carriages of a train\nwhenever the engine runs off the rails, so as to prevent\nthe rest of the train being dragged after it over em-\nbankments or bridges. The ordinary coupling consists\nof draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws'\nso as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train\nclose together. There are also safety chains, one on\neach side of the main coupling. The improvement\ncomes into action the moment the engine or tender\nhappens to diverge at a certain angle from the line\nof railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of\ngear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are\ndriven back by the springs into the void left by the\ndraw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are\ninstantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame\nof the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com-\npletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears\nthat accidents from engines running off the rails amount\nto more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci-\ndents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the\nIst of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from\nthis cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas-\nsengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861\nthere were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas-\nsengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862\nthere were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and\n282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci-\ndents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail-\nway, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and\ninjury to 161 persons, making together in the course of\n3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running\noff the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63\npersons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons,\nbesides involving destruction of rolling stock and large\nsurna for compensation. This indicates to some extent\nthe advantage of adopting the system of coupling\npatented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia-\nment-street, and which appears to be very complete in\nevery respect for the purpose intended. It is in course\nof being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains\nen the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from\nthat cause have heretofore been rather more frequent\nthan on other railways A full-sized model of the\napparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament-\nstreet, which will enable those who are interested in\npreventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It\nis rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of\nrailways have no power to require the adoption of any\nimprovement that might appear to them calculatedito\nprevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although\nthey have power to prevent the opening of a railway\nfor traffic until all the requirements as to the stability\nof the works and the efficiency of the signals have been\nfully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the\nrailway department of the Board of Trade.\n\nANOTHER DANGEROUS FREAK OF A SAILOR.\u2014On the\nmorning of December 10, about four o'clock, as the mail\ntrain going north was, passing through Broughton, on\nthe Lancaster and Preston Railway., about a mile south\nof the Broughton and Barton Station, a sailor, a pas-\nal\nfull\nreipea geeds. , stepped out\nIle fell on\nos efn\nthe\ner i\ntrainu on one\nso of thew asee cgoingon dt\nclasse carriages,\nthe line, but fortunately received no further injuries\nthan slight bruises on one shoulder and, one knee. There\nwere three other sailors in the same compartment, and\nall of them having been partaking rather too freely of\ngrog, they had been fast asleep.. One of them awaken-\ning, being under the impression that he was at his\njourney's end, got up with the intention of alighting,\nand stepped out, but was surprised on finding himself\ncast to the ground with much force. On recovering\nfrom the shock of his fall, he saw the signal light off\nthe station at Barton ahead, and made his way thither,\nand related to the astonished station master his adven-\nture. He remained at the station about fourhours, until\nthe arrival of the next train which stopped there when\nhe was sent onwards. Except that no startling there,\nof\na Muller-like catastrophe followed the discovery of the\nsailor having fallen from the carriage, the incident is\nsomething like one which occurred on the London and\nNorth Western Railway, a few days ago, when a drunken\n' sailor fell out of the train when at full speed, and his\ncompanions were apprenended on the charge of murder,\nand were only released on their companion appearing in\npropria persona, and unhurt, to tell the Pile\u00b0 he had\nnot been murdered.\nTHE PEACE ADDRESS TO THE -UNITED STATBS.\nWashington dispatch says :\u2014About six weeks ago, Mr.\nJoseph Parker, of Manchester, England, arrived at\nNew York, bringing with him the peace address of the\nsubjects of Great Britain and Ireland, with a letter\nfrom Sir Henry de lloughton to Governor Seymour,\nwho declined formally to receive it, ;\nase.gning as a\nreason that it should be given to the President of the\nUnited States, the latter being the only authorised\nchannel of communication between other nations and\nthe citizens of the United States. Mr. Parker, having\narrived here last week, addressed a note to Secretary\nSeward, stating that he had been deputed to this coun-\ntry to convey the address to the people of the United\nStates, and asking the honour of an oPPertunity of\npresenting it to the President. To this the secretary\nreplied that, before answering the letter, it was desir-\nable to be further informed whether Mr. Parker had\nany authority from the Government of Great Britain\nand Ireland for the purpose referred to, and whether\nhis mission had been made known to the diplomatic\nagent of that government near the e\nbevernment of\nthe United States. Mr. Parker replied bY saying that\nthe address he had the honour of bringing to this\ncountry, containing the signatures. of 350,000 of his\ncountrymen, from the peer to the artisan, was not from\nthe Government of Great Britain, nor from any political\nparty. It was simply an expression of the earnest\ndesire of Great Britain to see Peace restored to this\ncountry. The correspondence closed by a note from\nthe Secretary of State, in which he said the Govern-\nment of the United States could not receive the\naddress, and that the request for an interview with the\nPresident was, therefore, declined. The intention now\nis to present the address to Congress at the approaching\nsession. \u2022\nMATTHEWS AND THE REWARD.\u2014.There is RO truth\nin the watement that Matthews has received the\nreward offered for the conviction of Muller. The\nrailway company and the bank have handed over their\nrespective sums to Sir Richard Mayne, and when\nGovernment have added their portiun, the question of\nhow the money should be divided will then come under\nconsideration. It is said, however, that it will be\nequally divided between Mr. Death; Matthews, and the\ntwo Repsches. Inspector Tanner will not, as is gene-\nrally supposed, Come in for any portion of the reward.\nIn fact, beyond his salary, there is no recognition of the\nservices rendered by this intelligent officer, and unless\nthe public think proper to accord him some mark of\ntheir approbation he will go unrewarded. \u2022\n\nBREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE.\nIn the Court of C..ommen- Pleason December 10, an\naction\u2014Wylie v. Baser was brought to recover\ndamages for breach of promis- of marriage. The de-\nfendant, by his plead', gs, denied the promise, anal\nalsl alleged that a roast) ,able time for the ,performanoe\nof the promise had not been a lowed.\nMr. Gitiard and Mr. rll.l,,chlan were for the plaintiff;\nMr. Phil brick for the defendant,\nMr. G.ffard said he oelieved he could fully establish\nboth the promise, and the refusal to perform it, and that\nthe only question for the jury would be the amount of\ndamages. The plaintiff, Mrs. Elizabeth Mary Wylie,\nwas a widow. The oefendant was a grocer at South\nNorwood. The plaintiff had for some time been employed\nas a housekeeper; and it was through the defendant\nbeing in want of a houskeeper that he first met Mrs.\nWylie. He was gre aly taken with her. They\nbecame intimate, and at length the defendant engaged\nto marry the plaintiff on Cioydan :Fair day. The\ndefendant was a widower, between 50 and 60 years of\nage, with a grown up family, and after having engaged\nhimself to the plaintiff he introduced her to his family,\nand afterwards gave her to understand that they were\ngreatly p'eased with her. The letters which he had\nwritten to her would clearly show the relation in which\nthey stood. The learned gentleman then read the\nfollowing letters addressed by the defendant to the\nplaintiff:\u2014\n\n\"5, Porthurl road, South Norwood,\nAugust 10, 1864.\n\"My dearest Mrs. W,\u2014l arrived home quite safe\nabout eleven o'clock last evening. lam very pleased\nto say that I feel all the better for my trip, but did not\nlike parting with you, and watched you as far as I\ncould see you, but could not get you to look back after\npoor me.

He tells all my friends\nwhat a nice little body I have found, but he ,still\nwonders where I found you.

Ycu will,, my dear, quite\nunderstand how necessary; perhaps if she met you at\nmy house first, it would be too much for her. I was in\nLondon when your letter arrived this morning.

You will come by the train which\nleaves Victoria at 12.12, and I will meet you.--I am,\nmy dearest little pet, your own most affectionate\n\"W.\nIn a subsequent letter, Mr. Giffard continued, the de-\nfendant advised the plaintiff to go to Newington Church,\nand then she heard the banns proclaimed between\nherself and the defendant. In another letter he said,\n\"I do not think it is possible for me to wait until the\nfair. lam so cold at nights that you must come and\nkeep me warm.\" (Laughter.) It would be unnecesSary\nto read more letters. He (Mr. Giflard) would show\nthat the defendant refused to perform the promise so dis-\ntinctly established by the correspondeace. The defen-\ndant had a good business, and would be able to pay\nsubstantial damages. The lady being'3B, it might be\nthought her feelings were less acute than those of a\nyoung maiden; but it may be considered that this was\npossibly her last chance. (Laughter.)\nMr. Greenwood, the plaintiff's attorney, was called,\nand stated that after his first letter on the subject of the\npromise the defendant called on him and said he could\nnot perform his promise, as his children thought the\nplaintiff too young for him. He would pay the expense\nof cheap lodgings for Mrs. Wylie until she got a situ-\nation. He wished to see the plaintiff privately, but\nhe (the witness) would only agree to this on condition\nthat the meeting took place at his own office. In his\nre-examination, he stated that his reason for this was\nthat the plaintiff had told him the defendant had be-\nhaved improperly to her when they were alone.\nMr. Philbrick then addressed the jury for the defend-\nant, and said that he should be able to satisfy them\nthat the plaintiff had conseeted to the marriage not\n\u2022 taking place until a later period than stated, and that\nthis action was brought too soon, as a reasonable time\nfor the marriage had not arrived when the action was\ncommenced.\nTwo witnesses were called, a tailor and his wife, of\nwhom the defendant had ordered the clothes he intended\nto be married in; but their evidence,: taken at the utmost\nvalue for the defendant, only fixed the event for some\nday subsequent to the 22nd of October, when t3ix months\nfrom the defendant's first wife's death would have\nelapse 4.\nThe Lord Chief Justice summed up the case very\ncarefully to the jury, and pointed out to them the offer\nof the defendant to ' pay for cheap lodgings for the\nplaintiff until she could get a situation\u2014\" a very\nwithering change for one who expected to be his\nwife.\"\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014\nDamages, \u00a32OO.\n\nTHE KING OF PRUSSIA AND !lIS ARMY.\u2014The King\nof Prussia has issued the following order of the day to\nthe army The glorious war against Denmark is\nended.

The\nManches4.cr committee worked it op to then.\nThere is a rule I see here, namely rule 14, which\nis to this effect, these rules having all been certified\nby the Registrar of Friendly Societies, \"That the\nsums Id money received as subscription money from\nthe members of this society shall be applied to no\nother purpose than those set forth in these rules.'\nAre you aware of that P\u2014Yes, I am aware of that.\n'Phis society, as you say, is managed by a council\nand executive committee at Manchester. Do they\nreceive any payment for the management of :fhe\nsociety ?\u2014Yes, they receive is. 6d. a night and 4d.\nfol. allowance.\nWhat is the largest sum that you have ever heard\nof as heft\u00b0y,. paid to the council for one month's ex-\npenses ?\u2014About ti.s. is the most that was paid\nwhen I was on the council, but since then they have\nreported as much as 48s. per man, that is -245. to\neach report. Half of that 18s. would be booked to\nthe accident account and half of it would be hooked\nto the trade, I mean 48s. for each man, there being\ntwelve of them.\nFor their attendance during one month*F\u2014Yes,\n245. would be chargedlo the accident fund out of\nthat amount.\nDuring the time that you were treasurer did any\ninstances come under yew notice in Which you\nthought that any persons who had part inthe man-\nagement ofthe society, had appropriated to them-\nselves more than they should have done'?\u2014When I\nwas elected.the treasurer'(it is the treasurer's duty\nto hold the bank-book), when the bankbook was\ngiven up to me I examined the report and the money\nthat was in the bank, and there was a deficiency of\nabout Da. On the next meeting I 'brought the\nsubject up. Generally after business they ask the\nmembers if there is any other buSiness to\nlay before the meeting. When that question was\nasked I-said I had some business. 'wanted to\nknow whether the last bank entry had:been reported\nin the report, and they said it had not. I wanted\nto know where the \u00a33O was that was the deficiency ;\nthey had (lent 3.230 to the Warrington lodge, and\nthe interest on the amount made up the \u00a33O\nalong-with the \u00a3l7 that I bad found -deficient. Of,\ncourse they had to acknowledge that it was lent then,\nWas that all repaid P\u2014Part of it, the other was\nnot.\nWas part of it repaid by the Warrington lodge ?\n\u2014Yes, \u00a3I.S.\nDo you look to the Warrinkton lodge for the\nzest of the payment P\u2014l left the council after I had\nbeen treasurer three months, and had to go to\nBarrow-in-Furness.\nYou were referring to some large sums that were\npaid on account of strikes at Manchester. 3..)0 you\nknow what was at any timeTaid by-that society on\naccount of the strikes at Manchester ?\u2014Yes, \u00a3920,\nas I stated at first, was granted by the delegate\nmeeting.\nWas that \u00a3920 taken out of the general 'fund ?\nTaken out of the amount. The whole of the money\nis put in .the bank in the name of the Accident and\nBurial Society.\nThen it becomes the general fund, ?\u2014Yes.\nWas the 20 which you refer to taken out of the\n;eneraltund of the society ?:\u2014Yes.\nDo you know what was the amount .of the fund\nhands of the society at that time ?\u2014I could get\ne ;know titat.\nCan yott\u2022tell us about the amount P\u2014We had two\ntorts, and about \u00a31,600 and some odd pounds in\nte one 3..,300 and some odd pounds in the\n4s,r ; altogether \u00a33,000 .before the strike com-\n\n;need. ,\nTo what' account was the \u00a39OO credited, because\nti have told as that the two accounts were kept\n)arate P\u2014lt would be taken from the trade\nfount, that exhausted nearly all the funds of the\nie; then they called a delegate meeting through\n' pamphlet I spoke of, and this delegate meeting\n.\u00a31:20. They would have to take \u00b0the greatest\nion of that \u00a3i.2o to revise the trade rules, and\nwould be taken from the accident fund.\niring this time that the money was being paid\n!count of the Manchester strike out of the\n7al fund werethecontributions of the Manches-\n)dge paid regularly ?\u2014No, they owed at one\n-about \u00a397 to the general fund, but they were\n3d forward in the .report as if they did sot owe\ning.\nat I suppose arose from the fact that the men\nwere members of the society in Manchester at\ntime were out of emploYment F\u2014No, it was\n&Ise they were using the money for the strike\nad of paying the contributions to the Qxecutive\n5.61, and that executive council being members\ne Manchester lodge kept them straight with the\n1, so that if there were any accidents or deaths,\n,\n, wovld be entitled to the benefits. They re-\nrted them as if they did not owe anything.\ngr. Roebuck: So that the executive council\nIsified the accounts P\u2014Yes, they did not issue a\nper report, it was a false report\n7,arl of Lichfield: You will put in these rules I\nlose ?\u2014Yes I should. like to mention this case. A.\n'slim came to London from Wolverhampton\ntrike. They had a lodge at Wolverhamp .\nIllk\nof the Manchester Society and of the\nDeiety, and the London Society men closed\n:e without the sanction of the Manchester\nA. deputation then came up to London, and\nut \u00a3l2O.

You never sent any returns to Mr,\nTidd Pratt P\u2014They did at first.\n\nMr. Roebuck: Since you added the trade society\nis it that you have become a trade society as well as\na benefit society. Have you sent any rules to Mr.\nTidd Pratt P\u2014Not after that. That is the last certi-\nfied list of rules they have.\nWhen did you become a trade society?\u2014They\nwere a trade society before I joined. I joined them\nin 1845.\n\nYou have become a'trade society since those rules\nbefore us were certified, have you not ?\u2014lt was a\ntrade society before.\nDid you send any of your [trade society rules to\nMr. Tidd Pratt P\u2014l did not suppose they did.\nThey did not let Mr. Tidd Pratt know that they\nwere a trade society P\u2014l should not think they\nwould; but that was before my time.\nHave you ever heard of this consequence following\nfrom that-proceeding, that when after some person\nrun away with the trade society's money you came\nto the magistrate to redressthat wrong. He said to\nyou that he covld not help you because you were a\ntrade society ?\u2014They did not prosecute under trade\nyules ; they prosecuted under accident rules.\nDo not you suppose they knew P\u2014All the magis-\ntrates about Manchester knew that they were a trade\nsociety.\n\nEarl of Lichfield: In 'these rules certified by Mr.\nTidd Pratt there is a rule providing for the settle-\nment of disputes and referring cases to arbitration.\nAre you aware of any case of dispute that has been\nreferred to arbitration under that rule in your\nsociety ?\u2014No. They have never appointea any\narbitrators for the society.\n\nMr. Roebuck: T suppose you have had disp-utes?\n\u2014As to accidents rules. There was one county\ncourt affair at Bowden.\n\nWhat was the result of that ?\u2014The man got his\nmoney from the county court, and then the judge's\ndecision was put on one side, and then the man could\nnot carry it out\n\nDo you- know for what reason it was put on one\nside ?\u2014There is a rate that all disputes Are to be\nsettled by arbitration; he went to law instead.\nDid you ever hear that it was put aside because\nyou were a trade society P\u2014No ; it was because he\nbrought it in court, instead of going to arbitration.\nThe man brought the action against the society\nunder the understanding that it was a benefit\n. _\n\nsociety P\u2014Yes. .\nThe county court judge gave it in his favour ?-\nYes.\n\nThe ease was -sent to London, and in London the\njudge's decision was reversed ?\u2014Yes,\nDid you ever hear why.it was reversed ?\u2014Yes, it\nshould have been settled by arbitration.\nDid you ever 'hear why the man could not carry it\nout P\u2014l suppose he was short of funds.\nDid you ever 'hear that the man could not carry it\nout because the -society was not only a benefit society,\nbut a trade society suppose he had no money:\nDid you ever hear that the reversal of that decision\nwas in consequence of its being a trade seciety_P\u2014\nIt was not putin that liEht-by the society.\nBut did. you. ever hear that from the newspapers?\n\u2014No; it would not be put in the papers.\nDid ever any liawyer tell you what it was owing\nto P\u2014No ; lawyer Bent got the judge's decision put\nback, and the man never got his money.\nDid he not ever tell you that he could not enforce\nanything against the society because it was not\nmerely a benefit-society but a trade society also P\nNo.\n\nAre you quite sure am sure that nothing was\nsaid of that, if it was spoken of at the time I did not\nunderstand-it. r.\nIt might have tecui said then without your know-\ning it P\u2014l cann&t cay what was the reason why it\nwas put back. At all events the man aid not get\nhis money. That is the Only lawsuit I know Of.\nHave you ever 'heard of any lawsuit being brought\nagainst the society \u2022since P\u2014No.\n.Tfava you. evcr ar the bs\u2022oiciy. bringing an\naction against anybody else P\u2014Not in the brick-\n.\n\nlayers.\nNot since that decision you mean P\u2014No, not since\nthat decision.\n\nBut your society is :now not only a benefit society,\nbut it is a trade 4; ociety also 9\u2014Yei, and it was\nbefore those rules were ,certified.\n\nBut when those rules were certified you did. Rot\ntell Mr. Tidd Pratt that you were a trade society,\ndid you ?\u2014That was before my time.\nEarl of Lichfield : ?Sow many members were there\nin this society at the time that you were treasurer?\n\u20143,000.\n\nAnd you have told no that you found that,\nalthough the rate fixed in the rules which were\ncertified. by Mr. Tidd Pratt was at least 3d. per\nweek as the contribution for the funeral benefit, you\nreduced to a halfpenny ?\u2014They have done so.\nAnd you have drawn an inference from that that\nthe rates were too high, and that at your present\nrate arti with your present mode of expenditure\nyour income will meet your expenditure ?\u2014Yes.\nWill you tell me upon what grounds your society\nhave ever calculated what funds they ought to have\nin hand to place the society in such a position as\nwould enable it hereafter to meet all the liabilities\nand funerals of its members ?\u2014I do not suppose\nthat they have made any calculations of that at all,\nthat is what I was- speaking of, that that accumu-\nlated fund would be a guarantee in case of an\naccident.\n\nYou see thalf you have to pay a sum of \u00a38 upon\nthe funeral of every member P\u2014Yes.\n\nAnd you Qay tha up to the time that you are\nspeakirg of you found that the fund was always\n,sufficient to meet it ?\u2014Yes.\n\nSupposing a case of any epidemic or anything of\nthat kind which cou:d increase for a time, and very\nconsiderably increase the number of deaths, do not\nyou think that your society ought to be, as a friendly\nsociety, in such a position as to have a considerable\nfund at its disposat to meet such an emergency?\u2014\n\nIt ought. It depenris upon the number of inem-bers,\nif the number of members were to drop, the society\nwould not have enough to meet that.\nDo you think that those who have the manage-\nment of that society have made any calculations\nwhatever, or have really considered for a moment\nwhat their position for the future might be P--No, I\ndo not remember it ever being mentioned.\nMr. Hughes: Suppose that the funeral fund had.\nfallen short in your time, what would have been\ndone in the society ?\u2014lt would have :been paid out\nof the trade fund, as long as the members kept\ntogether.\nSuppose that there was no trade fund, what would\nhave been done P\u2014They would have put a levy on\nthem, or they would have had to go without.\nDo you ever reinember a levy being put on for a\nspecial purpose in your society ?\u2014Yes, for trade pur-\nposes.\n\n-\n1 There never was any necessity in your time for a\nlevy for accident purposes P\u2014No, not for accident\npurposes.\nNor for funeral purposes P\n, the 3d.\n\n\u2014No, nothing beyond\n\nI wish to see whether there has ever been an\ninstance of the fund falling short, and how the ease\nhas been met if there has been. You say that if the\nfund had fallen short it would have been met by a\n'levy, but that in your time no levy ha 3 been neces-\nsary P\u2014The number of members la_ray time was\nnever less than 600 members, and Of course 600\n\u2022 -I:pall M.34,-each cleared it.\nEarl of Lichfield At the tini(that you are\nstaking of, at what age were.-- your members\n_tvritteci, had you any fixed age ?\u2014Yes, 18.\nThey\nAn\n\u2014Y\n\n-\"R\n\u2014Tt just depends upon the num\ntick together; perhaps after a strike\nnot be \u2022 many members that !_ would . sti\n\nsociety, a strike might upset the society and Mil\nonly a few in who would be receiving accident\nmoney. _ . _\n\nMr. Hughes: During your time the number of\nmembers have varied from 600 to 3,000 P\u2014Yes,\nthere are 5,000 now.\nHave they steadily increased in number P\u2014They\nhave never decreased to less than 600.\nBut have they ever been at one time 3,000 arid\nthen 2,500 afterwards, for instance P\u2014They have\ngot up to 1,200 and then got back to 600.\nSo that 600 men must have left at that time P\n\nThey went, of course, off the accident and the\nfuneral fund entirely F\u2014Out of the trade entirely;\nthey went away andibecame non-soeiety men.\nThey would no longer have any claim on the\nfunds of the society P\u2014No. Then since Locket went\naway with that \u00a31,300 they altered the initiation\nmoney, that is to say, they took members in for less\nmoney. The Manchester society now numbers about\n5,000, 1 believe, and the London society about the\nsame.\n\nEarl of Lichfield: May I ask if you belong to a\n-friendly society now ?\u2014Yes, I belong to the\nForasiers. _ _\n\nWhen did you join the Foresters F\u2014About five\nyears ago.\nChairman: Has that society any trade purposes?\n\u2014No. The Foresters is a sick and benefit society,\nthat is all.\nThe witness withdrew.\n\nTHE LAND QUESTION.\nTe THE EDITOR OF THE BEEHIVE.\n\nSIR,\u2014An important occurrence has taken place\nsince my last communication upon the above sub-\nject ; which induces me to return briefly to the land\nquestion, and ask your kind permission to insert a.\nfew remarks on what took place at the\" Confer-\nence on the Irish Church,\" on the evening of the\n11th instant; and also to endorse every word con-\ntained in one of your leading articles in relation\nthereto in last week's BEEHIVE.\n\nAccording to the reports of the London press,\nMr. Mason Jones moved a resolution affirming the\nprinciple of \u2018! The ecclesiastical revenues of that\ncountry being applied to purposes calculated to\npromote its secular interests ;\" and, in his excellent\nspeech in support of that view, took occasion to say,\nthat \"As regarded the application of the funds of\nthe Irish Church, he had a proposition to make\nwhich he did not think had been previously sug-\ngested. In Ireland they had millions of acres of\nland at present unclaimed, and it would be a prac-\ntical proposition to devote the funds of the Irish\nChurch to the purposes of reclaiming these waste\nlauds. The land so reclaimed to be let direct from\nthe Crown, and they would get a peasant proprietary\nin Ireland who would have a direct interest in their\nloyalty.\"\nThe Rev. Mr. Doxey said, \"The suggestion of\nMr. iones was a most practical one, which they\nmight present to the Rouse of Commons, because it\noffered some solution of the land question.\" Well\ndone, Mr. Jones and Mr. Doxey. The ball begins\nto move in the right direction, and may it roll\nonward to its final goal, is my most ardent wish.\nWhat, however, seems to me somewhat singular\nand amusing is, that the Rev. C. Neville and Mr.\nT. Dunning are reported as taking part in a meeting\nwhere such a \"dreamy\" and \"impracticable\" sug-\ngestion as \"letting the land direct from the crown\"\nis said to have been received with such favour.\n\nI wonder whether these two gentlemen fled from\nthe meeting in dismay when the idea of \"holding\nland direct from the crown \".was suggested, which,\nin other words, simply means the state; or whether\nthey retired into a corner of the room in a state of\nalarm for the fate of their adopted child\u2014land-\nlordism. The fact that men of education and high\nattainments were absolutely \"dreaming\" about\n\"letting land direct from the crown\" instead of\nselling it to the men with the money bags. I sin-\ncerely hope it had as happy an effect upon these two\ngentlemen as it appears to have had upon the\nmeeting.\nz . \u2022 ..\n\nI als-o c\/ommend to the serious attention of Mr.\nStephenson, of Halifax, the excellent suggestion of\n3-fr. c 1.1-=.4 above ineetintr. T havn pd_set\nbeen able to learn that gentleman's views upon the\nland question from anything he has written, but if\nhe approves the doctrine of Mr. John Stuart Mill,\nwhich he quotes, namely :\u2014\" That the claims of the\nlandlords to the land must be, and always is, subor-\ndinate to the general policy of the state,\" I have\ngood hopes of him.\nIn conclusion, I beg to say that if avik.Dublic\nmeetingtan be got upon the subject the begi fling\nof the new year, as suggested in last week's\nBEEHIVE, I shall be most happy to attend it, and\nso far as possible promote the objects of the meet-\ning. _ ALFRED A.

Having seen a balance-sheet of\nthe Reform Fete and Banquet in your edition of last\nSaturday, I most distinctly deny being indebted to\nthe committee at all; in fact, it is the other way,\nfor they are indebted to me for wages due, and\nwhich never yet have been settled. And in respect\n, to the receipt held by Mr. Murray from me, it is the\nsame as every other receipt given, and is entered in\nthe book as such, and was checked by the auditors,\nif such you call them,: for I am perfectly satisfied\nthey know as much about the accounts now as they\ndid before ever seeing' then. If that is not the case,\nwhy have they not published the whole of the de-\nfaulters; or perhaps they thought it much easier to\n, put it all on to me, whom they rEpresent as financial\nI secretary, but which .was never my position.

It was generally\nagreed that if any resistance were offered on the part\nof the hands many establishments would he altogether\nclosed. Ten per cent. is to be the amount of the\nreduction, and all hands, with the exception of the col-\nliers, will have to submit to it.

The intelligence will be\ngratifying, because while the greater part of\nthe shareholders went into the business partly\nfor benevolent motives, yet capital cannot be.\nfound for the cultivation of cotton from philan-\nthropy. A company may be formed to try an\nexperiment, and money may be found to work\nit by parties who care not whether they gain or\nlose by the business as a monetary matter, but\nwhose great object will be secured by discover-\ning that they have been engaged in a profitable\ntransaction. Experiments are not substitutes\nfor industry, and the latter cannot be excited\nor maintained without remuneration. The\nJamaica Cotton Company has proved the capa-\nbility of growing first-class cotton on the\nI island, and it will next prove that the business\nmay be done at a paying price.\nFrom an address by Mr. Bourne, their secre-\ntary, to the operatives engaged in their planta-\ntions, which has been published in this country,\nwe learn that the Company has adopted an\nexcellent principle in settling the relations\nbetween the employers and those persons who\nare engaged by them. The Company will pay\na fixed rate of wages for work done, to be sup-\nplemented at the close of the year's accounts by\na part bf the profits realised. Thus the opera-\ntives become interested as partners without\nrisk in the success of the work. Although they\nhave no direct liability for failure, yet they\nhave all the excitement of responsibility. '1 hey\nhave even the risk of expected earnings. Ac-\ntivity and economy brings them a reward in\naddition to weekly pay, for skill or toil. Tinder\nthis system, fairly administered, the in-\nterest of all classes may be consulted\nand secured. Capital and enterprise\nreap the reward to which they\nindisputably entitled, and labour and skill wi\nsee in the prosperity of their avocations\n\nare\n\nsecurity for their own well-being. This is the\nonly principle on which we can expect to have\nthe interestS of capital and labour reconciled.\nWe know that it is the duty of the employer\nto give a fair day's wages for a fair day's work,\nbut difficulties arise in estimating the precise\nsum, and they are. in this manner entirely\nobviated.\n\nWe have had reason ere now to mention\nfavourably the plan and purpose of the Jamaica\nCotton Compai y, and their adoption, at the\nbeginning, of a good principle in the division\nof results, entitles them to good wishes for\ntheir prosperity and success. An agitation has\nbeen commenced in this country against the\npurchase of goods made from slave-grown\ncotton. Ladies in some places have signed\ndeclarations of their purpose never more to be\nclothed in ginghams or prints tinged with the\naccursed thing. It is right to banish Achan\nfrom the camp or the household, if the ladies\ncan identify him, but they will experience\ndifficulty in discriminating between the false\nand the true. We have seen a sugar mer-\nchant's taste vindicated in the discovery by\nthat test alone of the nativity of specimens, not\nshown to him, but placed in his mouth. He\nwas an excellent judge of the commodity, for\nin one case he confessed that he had never\ntasted sugar previously of the description\ngiven to him, and could not say where\nit had been grown. The specimen was taken\nout of a small parcel made from a new material.\nBut we do not believe that free grown cotton\nturned into goods and yarns can ever be dis-\ntinguished from slave grown, by sight or taste.\nParliament could levy a discriminative tax on\nslave- grown cotton, but it will not adopt that\ncourse; and a better remedy will be found in\npromoting the growth of this commodity in the\ncolonies and in India. The ladies who have\nadopted this discriminative declaration should\ntake an interest in the cotton-growing coin-\npanics; accomplish their objects and earn\nfive per cent.; and larger dividends may be\nearned, which the shareholders, if they dislike\nthem, need not spend.\n\nDEATH IN THE PIT.-DITTIES OF\nINSPECTORS.\n\nr resume our remarks upon the subject of\nthe Edmund's Main Catastrophe, from last\nweek.\n\nThe fact is, in the South Yorkshire district,\nthe inspector is a known sympathiser with the\ninterests of capital. To him labour is but a\nthing with which the less law interferes to\nprotect the better. True to his politico-\neconomic creed, he gets as much salary and\ndoes as little for it as he can. He never visits a\npit when he dares to stop away. He never\nmakes a tour of inspection to see the law is\nobserved to prevent accidents; and, when sent\nfor by the men's fears, either notice is sent of\nhis coming, or some hint is given about the\ncomplaint, so that when a flying visit is made\nthere is nothing to see, and the men get a\nrebuke, or a discharge.

It consists of a couple of shafts only a few\ndozen yards apart, both of which run through a valu-\nable series of coal beds, the chief of which are the\nPember.on five feet, the Pemberton feet, and the\ncannel. This latter lies about 500 yards from the\nsurface, and in one of these two shafts\u2014that in which\nthe accident occurred\u2014the sinking to this important\nseam has progressed so favourably that but some half\ndozen yards of rubbish remained to be sent up and the\nlabours of the sinkers would have been ended. Between\n8 and 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning a party of a\ndozen men were at work in the shaft in question, when\nit was found necessary to blast a portion of the strata\nthrough which they were passing. Two-thirds of the\nworkmen were hoisted to the surface, where they were\njoined in a few moments by their companions as soon\nas they had set fire to the fuze which was to light the\npowder. The blasting seemed to take place in a proper\nmanner below, and at ten minutes to nine a party of\neight men were again lowered. The engineer was,\nhowever, astonished to find that the hoppet containing\n- ?Lit,\n,men stopped in the shaft when it was still a few\nyardi\n;',.\nthe bottom, and he was still further sur-\nprised to not e the rope swaying to and fro in the pit.\nA shout down t' nit elicited no response, and the alarm\nbecame general wh.o it was found that it was impos-\nsible even with the ti\nted strength of two engines of\nvast power to move the\nBryham the manager, an 2ther\nth2.pipset from its position. Mr.\napprised na\nof the accident, and ha.. 74 gentlemen weris\nned to t bre,\nwhere measures were soon taken team the\ntrue state of affairs below. A new rope had\nto be placed on the drum, it being found impossible\nto move the five hundred yards then in the\nshaft. By noon this was accomplished, and a hoppet\nhaving been attached to the new rope the foreman of\nthe sinkers and a couple of assistants descended the\npit to learn the fate of those below. They reported\nthat the whole of the last range of brickwork-13\nyards deep, and running entirely round the shaft, 16\nyards in diameter\u2014had fallen to the bottom, burying\ncompletely the hoppet and the men in it. Eight active\nworkmen were at once sent down, and load after load\nof debris were sent up, and after great labour succeeded\nin reaching the hoppet with the men, five of whom\nwere found to be dead, and three alive in the hoppet,\nnot much injured.\n\nTHE YEAR 1864.\n\nThe year 1864 opened with a stormy aspect for\nEurope generally, while in America there was no pros-\npect of peace. In Denmark it was clear that there\nwould presently be an invasion of the Duchies. Poland\nwas in the depths\u2014not of despair, for the Poles never\ndespair\u2014but of ruin. The Emperor of the French was\nin his balancing mood; and there was no saying what\nhe would ain about adhering to the Treaty of 1852, or\nanything else. We were in dread of evil tidings from\nvarious quarters. The little war on the north west\nfrontier of India was more serious than we had\nsupposed; and Lord Elgin's death had left the\ncountry without a ruler at a most critical time.\nThe consolation was that Sir John Lawrence was\non his way out. The New Zealand war had\nassumed a very grave appearance; and we were in sue-\nTense about what would happen in Japan after the\n--affisir of Kagosima. As for the end of these uncer-\ntainties\u2014the little war in India was soon at an end\u2014to\nbe succeeded by another on another part of our frontier.\n.Beyond the Punjaub everything is settled for the pre-\nssen ; but we have a quarrel with Bhootan, in every\nway vexatious. The New Zealand war was supposed\n.\u2022 to be over in August; but fresh menaces have arisen,\nand-we.are not much happier about that colony at the\n. close of the year than we were at the beginning. In\n\u201ejapan, the affair of Kagosima seemed rather to tend\nto peace than the contrary; but new troubles\nare always arising there when everything seems to\nbe settled; And we hardly feel more secure of a\ngood. footing and a prosperous commerce now than\nwe did twelve months ago. In China the change\nAtas been more essentOhan we expected. The taking\n\u2022 .of Nanking in July; and the breaking of the heart of\nthe rebellion by that achievement, has afforded us the\nproper opportunity for determining what we shall do,\n\u2022 and what we shall abstain from doing, in regard to the\ndifficullies of half-barbarous countries line China,\nwhen their inevitable fate overtakes them. We had\ndeclined interference in Mexico, and the procession of\nevents there has satisfied us with our decision. We\nhave seen the French occupation becoming fear-\nfully costly in all ways: we have s.len the new\n.Emperor entering the country and the capied\namidst acclamations; we have seen him doing all\nthat was possible towards bringing Mexico into a\ncondition to be well governed, and we find in Pre-\nsident Lincoln's recent message that \"the civil\n\"war in Mexico still continues.\" We were full of pity\nfor St. Domingo when the year opened, and so we are\nnow; but the inhabitants have continued their resist-\nance till they seem likely to see the Spaniards sail away\nhomewards as their nesghbours, the Haytians, saw the\nFrench depart on a similar occasion. Spain has com-\nmitted other aggressions in that hemisphere during the\nyear; but they are so sure of their retribution that they\noccasion little anxiety to any but the parties immediately\nconcerned. As for the American conflict, we felt our-\nselves able to wait quietly for the issue. There seemed\nto bean end of solicitations to us to interfere; and the\ndistress in Lancashire was so far mitigated, and the\nprospects of a supply of cotton so far improved, that no\nexcuse was left for any importunity about intervention.\nSuch was the aspect of affairs when the sun rose clear\non New-Year's Day. That brilliant day was made all\nthe brighter to Europe by the pacific tone of the French\nEmperor's oracular utterances to the diplomatic visitors\nat the Tuileries. In a few days the weather grew fear-\nfully cold, inflicting intense suffering on the poor, and\ndeath on the aged and feeble. By degrees, too, clouds\nsettled down on the Imperial mind and countenance;\nand the prospects of Europe were as dark as they have\nbeen for many years. The Prince of August enburg had\nbeen proclaimed at Kiel at the close of the past year;\nno efforts made at Copenhagen to avert a collision were\ntreated with common patience or courtesy; and the\nfirst gunshot of the war between Denmark and the\nGerman Powers was fired on the 31st of January.\nBefore the middle of February Austria had repudiated\nthe treaty by which she had pledged herself to abide;\nand the embarrassment of the situation became extreme\nto the parties to the treaty who were other than Ger-\nmen. In this country the expectation of war was\nvery prevalent\u2014as it Would have been in\nFrance and Russia if the popular interest in\npolities had been anything like what it is with us.\nSince the Ministry were absolved by the critical vote of\nthe Commons on their foreign policy on the Bth of July,\nwe have at I.s:est known what to discuss, and have been\nfree to compare all the ideas which can exist under the\nterm non-intervention.; and thus, by the passing\nalarm of war we may have become better prepared to\nmeet or decline it, on the next critical occasion.\nDuring the months over which the uncertainty ex-\ntended, we witnessed the mournful spectacle of the\ninvasion and dismemberment of Denmark, and the yet\nmore painful manifestation of the worst points of the\nGerman national character. We have seen the consti-\ntutional prospects of Prussia overclouded or destroyed,\nand the dignity of Austria fatally impaired, while the\noutrageous violence of the Minister and the King of\nPrussia carried all before it.\n\nThe Polish insurrection went out with the hanging\n\u2022 of the chiefs of the National Government early in\nAugust; and the vengeance of Russia has had free\ncaurse ever since. The exodus of the Circassians' after\ntheir defence of their country against Russia for so\nmany years, has pained the world's heart\u2014the move-\nment being to the sufferers a concentration of famine\nancipestilence. Tens of thousands of the exiles did not\nwander long, but lay down to die wherever they might\n,be. The Arabs, again, have been showing that they\nare less satisfied or subdued under their rulers at Algiers\nand Tunis than had been supposed; and there has been\nmuch of the scattering warfare which characteripp\n. Northern Africa. We have witnessed the issii\nmore manifesto from Rome against 14.-\nof one\n..a\nknowledge and the development of progress of\nhave felt the effect of the Pope' philosophy, and\n.\nsuppression of the most lib admonition in the\nCatholic organs in this co\" and promising of\nclosing months of the\n- .ntry. And, through the\n.\nbearing of the .I.tal'- ,ear, we have watched the\n-he ope- ians, and especially the Piedmontese,\nundei ation of the Convention of September\n15. The riots at Turin were a melancholy spectacle;\nbut it presently became known that they were a sort of\n\u2022 accident, caused by folly and imprudence, and they\nwere soon forgotten in the nobleness of what followed.\nIn Ametica the aspect of affairs has been not less painful\nas the year has advanced. The war has been prose-\ncuted with unabated vigour, but, notwitbStanding\nrecent successess, with no decisive result. The re-election\nof Mr. Lincoln as President by an overwhelming\nmajority proves that the ,population of the Federal\nStates is still hopeful and resolute in its determination\n\nto reconquer the South. On the other band, the\nConfederates are still unanimously pledged to maintain\nthe independence which they have for more than three\n_ _ _ . . _ _\n\nyears deiended vith a heroin almost unparallelled in\n\nhistory.\nOn the Ist of June the Greek flag was hung out at\nCorfu. We had 3 ielded up the lonian Islands to the\nState to which they desired to belong.; and it was a\nmore blessed day to our country than if it had marked\nthe annexation of new territory. In the middle of July\nthe fii st intimation was made in Canada of the project\nof a Federal Union of our North American provinces,\nwhich has since made such progress as to constitute the\n. . . _\n\n_\nmost important feature of th_ e British policy of the\nyear. In India there has been much good work done,\n' under the rule of Sir John Lawrence, and foremost\namong his good works stands his rescue from death of\nthousands of \u2022 British soldiers and civilians, and of\nnatives, by a stirring bedinning of sanitary reform.\nAmidst serious calamity\u2014such as the hurricane and in-\nundation along the eastern coast, and the apprehended\nfamine from drought, already felt in its beginnings\u2014\nthe prosperity of India has been marvellous, and the\ndevelopment of its wealth beyond all the estimates of\nits rulers. As for the rest, we have made same mis-\ntakes; as, for instance, in the little Ashantee war,\nwhich cost some hundreds of precious lives by bad\n.weather and fever. We have been roughly spoken of\nand unceremoniously used in our Australian colonies;\nbut this happened while conciliatory despatches on the\nconvict question were on the way ; and the altercatten\nmay be considered at an end.\nThe d-tys of Garibaldi's short visit to England in\nApril will stand out in the history of thousands of lives\nas a great festival of the emotions; and the unfortuna.e\nmisunderstanding about the causes of his departure\nwhich spoiled some of the pleasure, and impaired some\u2022\nof the memory it, will, from their nature, be soon for-\ngotten, if they are not already. The day after he dis-\nappeared front the public eye we were celebrating the\nthree huedredth birthcLy of our own greatest man; but\nthe festival was not so well worth remembering as those .\nin which Garib dal was the object of honbur. Though\nearnest and generous efforts were made by individuals\nand groups of ci,izens all over the country\u2014and espe-\ncially at Stratford-on Avon\u2014the 23rd of April was not\na festival day thi oughout toe country, -while it yielded\nso little honour to our Shakespeare that we are probalilv\nall very ready to forget as much of it as we can. The\nWimbledon meeting of Volunteers was the most sue.\n\u2022cessful yet held\u2014a really glorious gathering of the\n.citizen soldiery who have undertaken a large share of\nthe defence of the country; and there wouid have been\nno drawback, but that by an accident a man was bhot.\nThe British Association for the Advancement of\nScience met at Bah in the middle of September,\nWe need not relate how the returned African explorers\nwere the most prominent attraction, nor how eager the\npeers and commoners o; the kingdom of science were to\nhear Capt in Seeke's account of his doings at the sources\nof the Nile; nor whit a dismay fell upon us all when a\nmovemeht of his own gun had silenced him for ever.\nThe Social Science Meeting was a good one for the\ntransa; tion of much useful business, but somewhat dull\nin comparison with tortner years. Tee Agricultural\nmeetings of the autumn were of unusual int4rest, for\ntwo reasons among others. They marked the progress\nof steam tillage, on which the future of the landed\ninterest now largely depends; and they afforded means\n. for consultation among the owners of all kinds of stock '\n\n' about how to feed cattle, horses, and sheep, through the\nwinter and spring\u2014the ordinary resources being cut off\nby the summer succeeding the cold weather of the spring.\nThe harvest, as far as wheat and barley went, was\nadmirable. We need not describe how it was with the\nhay, the pastures, and the roots. We shall feel- the\ntruth long in the price of meat and dairy produce. Then\ncame the autumn storms, and the terrible catalogue of\nwrecks in the great gales in\n.November. Few years\npresent such an array of calamities as has passed before\nthe eyes of residents on our eastern coasts within the\nlast quarter of the year. The accidents of all kinds\nhave indeed been very disastrous\u2014as the bursting of the\nreservoir near Sheffield in March, the railway accidents\nto the Ascot train in June, to the Darlington- train in\nJuly, the collision at Bradford in September, and those\nat Blackheath and Pringbourne ; the-ferryboat accident\nat Glasgow, which destroyed nineteen lives; and the\nfires which have cost us the Savoy Chapel and Haber-\ndashers' Hall, with its antiquarian treasures; besides\nthe Limehouse conflagration, and the explosion in the\nPlumstead Marshes. The horrible railway accident in\nCanada, which destroyed a wholeeompany of emigrants,\nand the cyclone at Calcutta seem to belong to our\nexperience, as they happened within the bounds of our\nempire.\n\nkanufacture and trade have flourished, generally\nspeaking; and every incident which draws attention\nto the fortunes of the working classes shows that those\nclasses understand better and better how to obtain the\nthe full advantage of their earnings. In two years no\nless than two mi lions sterling have been deposited in.\nthe Post-office Savings Bank: the same amount is in-\nvested in co-operative associations; and some of the\nlegislation of last session\u2014as the Government Annuities\nAct\u2014will prove a great help in enabling the labouring\nclasses to become capitalists in their degree, and to\nobtain the same advantages from such money as they\nhave as richer men can command. The increase of\nWorking Men's Clubs, and the Industrial Exhibitions\nwhich have been so prominent in the last few months,\nare influences tending in the same direction. The state\nof the cotton market, through the notion of speculators,\nhas disastrously prolonged the suffering of the Lan-\ncashire operatives, and renewed their hardships on the\napproach of Winter; but they have turned so readily to\nother employments, and their interests have been so\nwell managed, that there can now be no doubt of their\nbeing safely carried through till the fast increasing\nsupply of cotton shall restore them to their old way of\nlife. The strikes of the Staffordshire and the Yorkshire\ncolliers, and the riots at Belfast are the domestic\ngrievances of the year. Those riots happened when the\nlate Viceroy was prostrated by fatal illness. His suc-\ncessor has entered upon office while the shame of the\nBelfast outrages was fresh, and when tte people\nof Ireland were beginning to be cheered by the return\nof good seasons, and a prosperous agricultural year.\nThe most distinct aspect shown by the- government\nand legislation of the country has been its- provisional\ncharacter. The interval has been more or less vigo-\nrously used this year in preparation for sustained enter-\nprise when the time shall come. There are to be\nreforms in the law, and reforms in the representation;\nand the Church is in a state of positive commotion about\nthe schemes over which its parties will struggle and\nstrive. This is one of the marked features of the year\nwhich we are leaving behind. In one of the proposed\nenterprises some progress has been actually made.\nNot only has a Royal Commission reported on our\ngreat public schools, but another Royal Commission\nhas been appointed to consider the whole eubjeet of\nmiddle-class educetion.\nThe Queen and her family have had their ex-\nperiences sweet and bitter, like the rest of us. Three\ngrandchildren have been born to the Queen\u2014our own\nfuture Prince of Wales, one at Berlin, and one at\nDarmstadt. Oar little Prince was born untimely into\ninto a cold-and then troubled world; but the warmth of\nthe national welcome was all the more fervid. His\nDanish mother has had all possible sympathy from the\ncountry generally; and her husband and she were\nfollowed with eager interest in their visits to her parents,\nand to the Royal Family of Sweden. The Queen and\nher children have made more than the usual journeyings\nto Balmoral and Osborne; and it was gratifying to the\nwhole country, as well as to the people of Perth, that\nshe found herself able to attend at the unveiling of the\nstatue-of- the Prince Consort in that city, in August.\nMuch was hoped from this ; audit more has-not followed,\nthere has been some relaxation since last year\u2014some\nfew guests admitted, and somewhat more oP intercourse\nwith the world outside. The Prince and Princess of\nWales have held levees and drawing rooms, and have\npaid ,a memorable visit to Cambridge University, and\nattended reviews, and enjcyed at Sandringham the\ndomestic repose so well earned. While the continental\ndespots have been circling about in Europe, like flies in\nthe air, as if for the purpose of encountering or avoiding\neach other, it was felt everywhere that the Queen of\nEngland could not go to Germany this year. Almost\nall the continental Sovereigns and their Prune-Ministers\nhave met, at various times and places; but Englalid\ndoes not want to enter into their counsele, under the\npresent aspect of affairs;. and the only represene,ative of\nour Royal Family has been Prince Alfred,\nwhere he received the Order of the 'ee at Berlin\neataek Eagle.\nIt has been a year of much sick unusual\n',\nmortality; and this appears in the!le-eag list of deaths of\nand:eeminent as well as common or\n'unknown men. Every-\nbody's first thought will be e\n, oi the two statesmen whom.\nold men little thought\ncastle and the Earl ) survive, the Duke of New-\n'of Carlisle. The Church has lost\ntwo Bishops\u2014 7e\nTurton,. of Ely, and Da.vys of\nPeterboroe `\nJoin The Navy has lost two Admirals\u2014Gage\nand R-\n-1 ,etimarea. Among the peers, two Dukes of Cleve-\naud have died within eight months of each other. The\npeerage of the Earls of Clare has become extinct. The\nDuke of Athole and the Earl of Aberdeen have died in\nmiddle life; and Lord Ashburton before he was old.\nFrom the House of Commons Mr. Spooner will be\nmissed. Among political agitators that too Cervantie\nhero Smith O'Brien must be first, in whatever year he\ndied; but there was also the sound and sensible William\nJohnson-Fox, member for Oldham. The lawyers have\nlost Sir William Atherton, late Attorney-General, and,\nSerjeants Merewethers and Stephen. In philosophy\nand science we feel the loss, not only of our Professor\nFerrier and Leonard Horner, but of the greater Struve,..\nthe Russian, and Sdliman the American. Pere-\nEnfantin, sometime chief of the St. Sineonian brother-\nhood, should rank with ardent workers whose work is-\ndone. With our own, lamented traveller and discoverer,\nCaptain Speke, we may remember Jules Gerard, who.\nhadhis own merits as an African traveller. In litera-\nture we have lost Walter Savage Landor, the poor poet\nClare Alaric Watts, Lucy Aikin, Catherine Sinclair,\nF. E. Smedley, and T. Colley Grattan, Adelaide A.\nProctor and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Colonel Torrens\nand M'Cullooh, busy men in the early days of political\neconomy, have died out in a good old age. George\nDaniel and C. Winston, Mr. Dan, Prof. Pillans, and\nNesseu W. Senior, have also left us during the year.\nOf actors we have lost Frederick Robson, and the\ngallant veteran, T. P. Cooke. In muse, M -yerbeer is\nthe world's loss, in which we share. Poor Behnes, the\nsculptor, in leaving his life of trouble, recalled many\nmemories of old achievements. Of painters, we have\nlost Dyce, and W. H. Hunt, David Roberts, and Lance,\nthe President of the Scottish Academy; Sir John\nWatson Gordon and John Leech.\n\nAUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND JAPAN.\u2014 The\nanti transportation movement is being. energetically\nprosecuted in Australia. The latest advices from New\nZealand mention no event of importance. The natives,\nwho were still in rebellion, were making preparations\nfor a renewal of the struggle. There is nothing of\nimportance from Japan. Sir Rutherford Alcock was\nexpected to return to England by the next mail.\nTim POPE'S ALLOCUTION.\u2014On December 26 the\nPope received the members of the Sacred College and\naadressed to them an Allocution, in which he said that\nin the present day robbery was committed under the\npretext of nationality. The triumph of the Church\nwas certain, the day only of that triumph being un-\ncertain. His holiness added that after witnessing the\ndestruction of the enemies of the Holy See and the\ntriumph of truth and virtue, he would exclaim with\nSimon, \"Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depar t in\npeace.\" All the foreign Amba.sadors, including Baron\nvon Meyendorff, have each had a separate audience of\nthe Pope. The Pope, in receiving the homage, the\ncongratualtions, and sentiments ot devotion presented\nby General de Montebello in the name of the French\narmy of occupation, said :\u2014\" Similar sentiments of the\nFrench army were manifested to me at Gaeta by a\nGeneral who is ow a Marshal, and subsequently by\nall the other Generals who have commanded the French\narmy, and who generously hastened to oefend the\nEternal City. I have always prayed for this army, for\nhim who directs the destinies of France, for his good\nclergy, and for all French Catholics. At the present\ntime I shall not cease to pray for and bless the\nCatholic nation, the Emperor, the Empress, and the\nImperial family, that God may accord them all necessary\nenlightenment.\nLINCOLN CIATIIEDRAL.\u2014WOTIS of restoration at the\nwest front of Lincoln Cathedral are about to be pro-\nceeded with, under the advice of Mr. Buckler, of\nOxford, who has tseen employed for many years by the\nDean and Chapter. What is now being done is to\ncollect the remains of old columns, removed long since,\nand copy them in the minutest deta,l in Lincoln stone,\nthe original material, in order to replace the columns of\nYorkshire grit,\nand at the same time to put in fresh\npieces in those parts of the Norman doorway which are\nperishing from age, these\nParts being also copied with\nthe most minute accuracy. It is a peculiarity of the\nLincoln oolite to become coated with a bard surface\nwhich preserves it, and all that is done at Lincoln is to\nremove the black sooty matter by which this surface is\noverlaid. This is done by first wetting the stone with\nwater from a brush, and then taking off the black wirh\na small tool, without either mallet or hammer, the tool-\nmarks of the old Norman workmen being left. Not\neven this process has been or will be applied to curious\nNorman carvings.\n\nFRIGHTFUL RAILWAY ACCIDENT.\n\nA most dreadful accident, attended with\" loss of life,\noccurred on the night of December 15,. shortly before 8\no'clock, on the Grand Trunk Railroad, about a mile and\na half west of the Detroit and Milwaukee junction,\nthrough a collision between the day- passiuger express\nwest and a freight train going east. The passenger\nI train was behind time and had made all the necessary\npasses, according to the telegraphic instruction, until it\nhad passed New Baltimore \u2022station, where, it is said,\nit had orders to cross the freight going east of the\nDetroit and Milwaukee junction. When it arrived\nthere, according to the story of the operator at the\nGrand Trunk Junction, it had orders' to proceed all\n:right. Under these instructions it passed the\n_junc-\ntion, when shortly afterwards the engineer thought\nhe discovered an engine ahead. The next moment\nhe heard the whistle to down breaks, when he imme-\ndiately gave a similar order and reversed-` his- engine.\nThere were with him in the cab at the time\ntwo other persons besides the fireman. Before they\ncould jump the two engines came crashing together in\nfrightful contact, literally making chaos of everything\nconnected with both. The engines were dovetailed\ninto each other in an inseparable manner, and the snail\nand baggage car of the passenger train driven partially\nthrough the forward passenger car, thereby causing the\nfrightful catastrophe which followed. The passenger\ntrain, which consisted only of two coaches and a bag.gaae car, was crowded-with passengers. Both cars were\nfilled to the utmost, so much so that scarcely even\nstanding room could be obtained. After the accident\nthose in the forward car who were not helplemly\ninjured endeavoured to get out as somas possible. It\nis said, and we give it upon the authority of one of the\npassengers that the baggage man, who, it appears had\ncharge of the train\u2014there being no conductor aboard\u2014\nor one of the breaksmen, shut the hind door of the car,\nand would not for some time allow the passengers egress,\nstating that there- was no danger. Immediately aftet\nthe smash occurred the stoves were up-et and the cars\ntook fire. In an almost incredible spice of time the flames\nenveloped the whole, with the exception of the last car,\nand how many perished time alone can tell. After re-\ncovering from the shock those who escaped turned their\nattentions to the rescue of those in danger, and suc-\nceeded in delivering several from the burning mass.\nWhile thus engagi-d they were forced to witness a sight\nwhich fairly curdled the blood in their veins, and to-\nwards the recital of which the pen denies its office. The\nmail agent,George W. Millen, from Port Huron, was\nfound to be jammed in between the baggage and for-\nward passenger car. His leg wart firmly held between\ntwo pieces of 'broken timber, and all efforts to rescue\nhim before the devouring flames etigulphed him in their\nfolds proved futile. The most herculean efforts to\nextricate his crushed and bleeding limbs were used,\nbut the rapidly spreading flames drove the labourers\nfrom their work, and they were faced to witness, him\nperish before their eyes, his heartrendering shrieks for\nhelp piercing their ears, until stifled amid the smoke\nand flames of the devouring element. God of Heaven, it\nwas a sickening eight, and completely enervated the\nenergies of those around in their duty to others pro-\nbably equally terribly situated. After thefire had burnt\ndown his charred trunk was taken from the-\nruine, the head, arms,. and legs completely devoured,.\nand the body roasted to a cinder. As we.\nhave stated, it is not known how many persons\nperished. We can, therefore, only as yet surmise the.\nnumber sacrificed to the catastrophe. Bome persons in\nworking among the ruins discevered a portion of a\nwomanra hoop skirt, and shortly afterwards-the bones off\na human being among the ashes. Another person drew\nfrom the ruins a portion of the bottom of a' silk dress,\nand a ticket, upon which was the address \"'Miss Mary\nBoorlingham, Oneida, N.. Y.\" But whether this\nbelonged to any one who. perished has not yet bees\ndiscovered.. It is said that a' lady and two children were\nin the oar, who have not turned up, and that a physician\nwho was in the city, awaiting the arrival of a- sister, or\nsome female relative, or both, mourns their absence.\nIt is probable that five on- six- have perished. Beyond\nthe melancholy death of Mr. Millen no other names\nhave transpired. The names-of the wounded, so far as\noould be ascertained, together with the nature of their\ninjuries, areas follows:\u2014Mr. Davidson, express agent,\nDetroit, head and face severely ;.a family named Ashley,.\nfor North Danforth, Massachusetts, consisting of a\nmother, son, and daughter, were more or less- injured.\nThe mother was severely injured about the head and\nface, and the son, it is ftured, is injured internally. He\nwas completely bewildered for some time. The\ndaughter, Mary,. had her arm. broken and- her leg\nseverely bruieed,.and appeared to be suffering intense\npain. They were on their way to Wisconsin, where-\nthey intended to- settle. Mr. Watson, a gentleman\nfrom Canada, internally, so badly as to be unable to\ngive an-account\nhis residence and friend&. A special\ntr.a4.ii left the central depot ,out 10 for the pur-\nPose of removing, the sufferers to the city. Or:jog to\nthe obstructions on the track only those who were acla\nto walk returned by it. Another special, however, was\ndespatched over the southern road to remove those\nwhose injuries- required careful handling. They were\nall brought in at a late hour, and their aufferings as\nkindly administered to as was possible under the cir-\ncumstances. The majority of them are strangers in ea\nstrange land, and should receive the kindest treatment,\nfrom our citizens. It is almost needless-to say that all\ntheir baggage was destroyed, which to several is an..\nirreparable loss. The mails-were also burnt, with the\nexception of slew- letters.\u2014,Detroit Free Russ.\n\nA RURGLA-It\u2022 CAPTURED AT BRIGHTON.\u2014A determined\nlooking fellow, who gave the name of Edward Marriott,\nand his age and residence as \"nowhere\" was charged\nat the Brighton police court, on January 3, with having\nattempted to .commit a burglary at the workshop of Mr.\nBright, a jeweller, in Castle square. In consequence\u2022of\nhaving lost a considerable amount of property twelve\nmonths since, Mr. Bright employed a night watchman\nnamed John Hawkins. About one o'clook a.m. Hawkins\nheard a noise, and secreted himself, Presently he\nobserved a,man pass from the leads of the School ot\nArt, which adjoins, on to the leads-of the workshop.\nThis depredator was followed by a. second, and then\nsomething was handed to them from the roof of the\nSchool of Art by a third accomplice. At this point\nHawkinsse;red the first man with his left hand, and,\npointing a pistol at one of ,the others, threatened to fire\nif he did not surrender. He followed up the threat by\nactually discharging the weapon, and one of the burglars\ncried out, \"I am shot. I'll surrender.\" But instead\nof doing so he and the third man, effected their escape.\nThe men whom Hawkins caught was held by him until\nthe police arrived. He was brought up before the\nmagistrates as stated, and by them remanded.\nTHE BANKRUPTCY OF STRAILLN, PAUL, AND. BATES.\u2014\nThis case has been frequently before the Court of\nBankruptcy, and January 3 was. fixed for a dividend\nmeeting. The total debts proved were \u00a34,46,778, and\na further dividend of 6d. in. the pound was ordered to\nbe paid, making a total of 4s. Bd. There- still remains\nin. hand of the assignee, \u00a33,203, and 414,000 more is\nexpected very shortly from the French. Government,\nupon receipt of which a. further dividend will be\ndeclared.\n\nDEATH OE SIR ALEXANDER BANNERMAN.\u2014InteIIi,\ngence has been received of the decease of Sir A.\nBannerman, Knight, who in 1857 was appointed to the\nchief command of the colony of Newfoundland. The\nancestors of deceased, who was cousin of Sir Alexander\nBannerman, Bart., were hereditary banner bearers of\nthe Kings of Scotland, in the tenth and eleventh\ncenturies. Born in 1783, his earlier years were passed\nin mercantile pursuits, and for some years he was a\nshipowner, merchant, and banker at Aberdeen, of which\ncity he was ultimately elected pi ovost. After the passing\nof the Reform Bill he was elee ad member for Aberdeen,\nwhich he continued to represent without interruption\ntill 1847. In 1837 he was elected Dean of Marischal\nCollege' and in 1851 he was nominated by Earl Grey,\nunder Lord John Russell's administration, to the\nGovernorship of Prince Edward's Island, when he\nreceived the honour of knighthood. He remained three\nyears in his post, which was afterwards exchanged for\nthe Governorship of the Bahamas, and three years sub-\nsequently, he was appointed to the chief command in the\ncolony of Newfoundland.\nROYAL SHOOTING PARTY.\u2014On January 3 their Royal\nHighnesses the Count de Paris, the Duo de Chartres,\nand another member of the ex-Royal family of Orleans,\nvisited Windsor Great Park, for the purpose of enjoying\na day's shooting among the well-stocked coverts and\npreserves of the Royal demesne. Every precaution had\nbeen taxen by the keepers to ensure plenty of game.\nThe Princes reached the Park about 11 o'clock, and were\nmet by Major-General Seymour, the deput3 -ranger, the\nparty being also joined by Lieut.\u2022 Colonel Marsh al, of\nthe 2nd Life Guards. Mr. Cole, the head keeper' as-\nsisted by a number of keepers and beaters, had charge\nof the proceedings, the sport being commenced in the\npreserves near Cumberland Lodge. Thence the Royal\nsportsmen shot over the covert on the right of the road\nleading to Virginia Water, a large number of pheasants\nand rabbits (hares being extremely scarce here) falling\nbefore the guns of the party. The best of the sport,\nhowever, was found in the large covert on the left of\nthe Obelisk drive, which was next explored with the\nmost favourable results. Along this drive the distin-\n\u2022 guished party, with a long line of keepers, advanced\nSlowly along the dry fern, driving the game, which\nevery moment offered first\u2022rate hits, in front of them.\nOne of the Royal game vans followed in the track of\nthe shooting party, whose success by half-past two\no'clock\u2014three hours and a half\u2014mounted up to over\n300 head, double barrelled breech loaders having been\nused by most of the party. Their Royal. Highnesses\nthen proceeded to the Royal fishing temple on the banks\nof Virginia Water, where a splendid luncheon had been\nprovided from Windsor Castle. The lake itself WWI\npat tly frozen, being covered with a thin coating of ice,\nbut not strong enough to bear skaters. After partaking\nof luncheon, the guests took their departure, having\ntifidently enjoyed an excellent day's sport.\n\nMR. GLADSTONE ON COAL RESOURCES\n\nMT. Henry Beckett, F.G.S., of Wolverhampton,\nrecently delivered a lecture in the Assembly Room,\nMold, on \"Geology in its application to the coalfields\nof North Wales.\" Sir S,ephen Glynn\u00b0 presidea. The\nRight. Hon. the Chancalor of the Exchequer was pre-\nsent, and moved a vote of thanks to the lecturer. He\ncongratulated the audience on the justice which Mr.\nBeckett had done to the,aealfield. ot Flintshire, stating\nAbet .he (Mr. Gladstone) was not satisfied with the\ntreatment which that coaifield had received in a variety\nof putilicltions. It had been assumed that because that\nwas an old coal-mini g di\u2022trict\u2014a district where for a\nlong period of time their forefathers:had been scratch-\ning and grubbing, es it were, the surface of the earth\u2014\nthe coals theie were exhausted, and there was no more\noccasion to think about them except just by way of\ngathering up some scraps and leavings which those who\n\u2022came before thent-hail not heen-able to extract from the\nbowels ot mother earth; but he himself had cherished\na hope, which had strengthened\n\u2022from year to year\nand which was now coming to a state of great\nconfidence and vigour, that it might likewise be\nconsidered as a Tory young coal\u2022mining district\u2014that\nit was a district to the real character of which people\nwere only just beginning really to awaken. \u2022 He\nthought the signs baet already appeared that this was a\ntrue conclusion, and he confidently looked for the\nmultiplication of thosa \u2022 signs from year to year. The\ngeneral rule in that district had been in former timas to\nstop at the main coal. It was assumed, for some reason\nor other, that that was the ne plus witra, the very\nfurthestpoint downwards of the coal measures, and the\nworkings in any seams under the main coal had been\nvery insignificant. But when they came to compare\nwhat had taken place in adjoining districts\u2014going, for\nexample down the bend of the Dee to the extreme of\nthe estuary\u2014they found great clusters of coal measures\u2022\ncropping up at different points, and it had never been\nproved yet that the whole of those coal measnr(s\nwere not lying undisturbed and tranquil under\nthe main coal, waiting to be dug up. It .was a\ndistrict in which they might hope that before\nlong deep shafts would be brought into operation.\nThey had now every reason to believe that the\ncoalfield of that district passed under the estuary\nof the Dee and connected itself with the Lancashire\ncoalfield ; and he was sanguine enough to believe that\nthe day was not far distant when the estuary of the\nDee, which now meant a vast surface lying almost\nuseless, would be recovered from the usurpation of the\nsea and brought under cultivation, while the mineral\nenterprise of this great country was at work under-\nneath. Referring to some observations by the lecturer\non the dismal prognostications supposed to have been\nwade by Sir William Armstrong in regard to the\nprobable exhaustion of the coal supply of this country,\nMr. Gladstone said he had been told that in those\nspeculations Sir William Armstrong referred simply to\nthe district within which he spoke.

Redditch, and\nhis wife, are in custody upon the charge of seriously\nill-treating two of their children, and thereby causing\nthe death of one of them. Prosser and. his family, ea\nin number, have only resided in that district for a\nfoitnight, having been. engaged by a farmer. The man\nhad four children of his own, and the female prisoner,\nwho is his second wife, bad two other children who\nwera illegitimate. A. Mrs. Ann Thurstans, a neighbour,\nwho had visited the house several times, noticed that\nthe children were not properly cared for, and she had\nalso heard the wcman complain of the trouble they\ncaused her. On Saturday night she was called in to\nsea the child on which the inquest was held, when it\napueared to be very ill. Its stepmother, according to\nthe father's account, had \"given it a little slap or two,\nand it had fallen down.\" Mrs. Thurstans gave informa-\ntion to the man's employer, who communicated with\nthe police, and subsequently two children, boys, were\nremoved to the lodging-house, and placed under medical\ncare, but one of them sank from exhaustion, and died\non Monday morning. When. removed, the children\nwere dreadfully- emaciated, and bore several bruises.\nDeceased's arms and legs were contracted, the ex-\npression of the face .wild and idiotic, the surface of\nthe body covered with dirt, and the hair full of vermin.\nThe opinion of the surgeon, founded upon a post-\nmortem examination of the body, was that death had\nresulted from exhaustion, produced by want of food\nand from cold. The prisoners have been taken\nbefore a [magistrate and remanded. The other boy is\nin such a weak condition that his life is despaired of.\nThe neighbours are !erg indignant at the fact that\nwhile these two children were in such a\nstate of\nsuffering and disease, the two illegitimate children of\nthe woman appear to be strong, hearty, and well fed.\nNmv p\u201e,B.\u2014The Session of Parliament which is\nnow rapidly approaching will see several\nnew faces in\nboth I:louses. The familiar form of the Duke of New-\ncastle has passed away from the House of Lords, and\nhis place will be filled by his eldest son, the Earl of\nLincoln, who in past years was a well known member\nof the House of Commons. The Duke of Cleveland,\nwho enjoyed his honours but a few months, has also\nPassed away, and his seat will be filled by his brother,\nLord Harry Vane, a distinguished member of the Lower\nHouse, who occasionally took a prominent part in its\nproceedings, and who, it *ill be remembered, nominated\nthe present Speaker for his high office. The Earl of\nSuffolk.j ertY n the late\nViscount\nConservative\nCadogan died ou the 15th of Sept., and at the meeting\nof Parliament Viscount Chelsea, his eldest son,\nwho for some time represented the borough of\nDover, will be entitled to take his seat in the\nHouse of Lords.

The new Earl\nhas just attained his majority, having been born on the\n11th of June, 1843. His Royal Highness the late\nPrince Consort stood sponsor to him at his baptism.\nThe death of the Earl of Stair, which has recently\ntaken place, creates another vacancy in the House of\nLords, which will be supplied by Viscount Dalrymple,\nwho will succeed as Baron Oenford, of Cousland, in\nthe peerage of the United Kingdom, the earldom of\nStair being a Scotch peerage. Lord Manners died on\nthe 14th of November, causing a blank in the House of\nLords. It will remain a blank for the present, inas-\nmuch as the successor to the title was born on the 15th\nof May, 1852, and will not, therefore, reach his ma-\njority. until 1873. The death of Lord Rodney, who\ndied on the 19th of August, will also create a blank in\nthe House of Lords, which. cannot be filled up until\n1878, when his successor, the Hon.

T. Colmore and.\nA. Dixon at the Erdington Police- court on December 29.\nA \"lady of respectable appearance,\" aged 30, who gave\nher nawe as \" Mrs. Young,\" was charged with stewing\n\u00a3BO, the property of-Maria Holloway. The prosecutrix\nis tie mother of Mrs. Perrins, who is the wife of a\nbrush menufac; urer in Camden street, Birmingham but\nwho res des in the Victoria road, Aston. On Tuelay,\nthe 13th u t., a lady, dressed in black, called at the house\nof Mr. Terries, in the Victoria road. She SAW Mrs.\nPerrino, and stated that she wished to rent a house of\nher. Mrs. Perrins said that she could not go with her\nto show her over it, as shiewas without a servant. The\nlady replis d, \"I know a young person that would just\nsuit you. Sue is an orphan, and when oat of a situation\nlives with me. My name is Mrs. Youn' g and I live in\nAlma street.\" Mrs. Perrins said she would see her, and\nit wasarranged that the \"young person\" should come on\nSaturday morning. On that morning the prisoner, who\nwas the \"young person,\" came and agreed with Mrs.\nPerrins, and she en- ered on her duties on Saturday night.\nThe prisoner said. her name was \"Ann.\" All 'went well\non the Saturday night, and on the next day, Sunday.\nOn Monday morning Mrs. Perrins went out to co lect\nborne rents, leaving the prisoner and three children in\nthe house. So soon as Mrs. Perrins was gone out the\npri,ozier locked the three children ma room, as she sail\nat their mother's desire, and went up-stairs \"to do her\nwork.\" On Mrs. Perrin's return she was going up-\nstairs, when the prisoner told one of the children; to call\nher down, or the baby, who was poorly, would die.\nThis was done, and Mrs. Perrino came down again.\nThe prisoner then said she knew a lady in Philip street\nwho had some very nice goose oil, which she WAS stye\nwould do the chili good, and she would go and fetch;\nsome. She went, but forgot to return. In the mean-\ntime, Mrs. Perrins had gone upstairs, and disovered\nthat \u00a3BO, which beionged to her mother, and which she\nhad left safe in a drawer, was gone. She commuiiic tied\nwith the police, and search was made in Alma st: eat for'\nMrs. Young. The lady in black could not be dis-\ncovered; but a house was found shut up, but in the\npossession of a Mrs. Harvey. The police, having\ngood reason to believe that Mrs. Young and Mrs.\nHarvey were \" closely \" connected, followed up the\ntrack after Mrs. Harvey, and discovered that she was\nresiding in a house at Potter's Hill, Aston. Police\nSuperintendent Bloxham, accompanied by a police con-\nstable and Mrs. Berrins, went there on Monday last.\nMr. Blozham knocked at the door and a female came.\nHe stated who he was, and demanded admittance. The\nfemale replied that she would not open the door, and\nshe drew an extra bolt across it. Access was then\nobtained at a bedroom window. The prisoner was\ncovered in the kitchen sitting before the fire, on wh oh\n20 quantity of paper was smouldering. Only Ss. 10.71,41.\nin money was found in the 15itise, but a receipted bill\nfor \u00a34 Ils, was taken from the prisoner's person. It\nwas also afterwards ascertained that the prisoner had\npaid between LSO and \u00a34O to different tradesmen within\nthe last few days. The same prisoner was then charged\nwith stealing three suits of clothes, value \u00a35, the pro-\nperty of Eliza Partridge, Warwick street, Walsall, on\nthe 15th of May last. The prisoner came on the 12th\nof that month to lodge with the.prosecutrix, and left\non the 17th. On the 18th the goods were misse\nand information given to the police. A descrip-\ntion of the goods was sent round to all the pawn-\nbrokers in the district, but nothing was-heard of them.\nThe prisoner gave the name of Ann to-the prosecutrix,\nand she.being sent for when the prisoner was in custody\non the first charge, recognised her. She then con-\nfessed that two of the suits were at Mr. Smith's, pawn-\nbroker, Potter's hill, and the other suit was Miss Mack's\npawnbroker, Phillip. street. The police found them\nthere. ,The prisoner was committedto the ensuing War-\nwick sessions on both charges. Mr. Dixon said he\ncould not let the opportunity pass without severely\ncensuring the two pawnbrokers mentioned. If they,\nwhen the notices were sent out, had given up the\nclothes the case would have come on then, arid the\nprosecutrix in the first ease would, in all probability,\nhave been saved the etrious loss of a large sum of\nmoney. Since the prisoner's incarceration she has\nconfessed to Superintendent Bloxhara that \"Mrs.\nYoung\" and \"Ann\" were the same person. That\nby the means of false hair and teeth, and different\ndresses, the so disguised herself that when\nshe appeared before Mrs. Perrins as, \"Ann,\"\nand in propria persona, that lady did, not re-\ncognise her. She insists that she did not steal \u00a3BO\nbut \u00a32l. She also states that on one occasion when\nthe police were searching her house for a cash-box sh \u2022\nwas washingAndhadtheaash-box hidden at the bottom of\nthe \"jowl.' On another occasion when, she was wanted\nherself she hid under the- counter of a grocer's shop,\namongst thebacon and cheese. Her history is a most\nremarkable one. At the early age of 19 she was tried\nat Erdington, on the Idth of July, and, after com-\nmitment, was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment.\nIn 1853 she was again sentenced, at Birmingham, to\n10 years' penal servitude. This was afterwards com-\nmuted to eight months. A short time after she again\ncame out of prison she was tried again at Birmingham,\nand sentenced. to four years' penal seruitude,. which\nterm she served at Brixton, returning in 11159. When\nthe came back she got married to a gun-barrel forger,\nand lived with him a short time. Nothing has since\nbeen heard of her until within the last few months. She\nis stated to be wanted in Birmingham on some half-\ndozen charges, and the police have for some time been\non the look-out for her.\u2014Birminghain Post.\n\nLETTER 7Eol`+l THE GEAND DURE NICAOLA.S. - The\nJiroscow Gacctie publishes the following letter addressed\nby the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia to the military\ngovernor of Moscow :\u2014\" Florence, December 10\nMichel Andreievitch,..\u2014Your letter, by which you offer\nboth to me-and' my future wife your congratulations on\nthe occasion of our betrothals, did not reach me until\n.after my departure from Denmark.

The ambassador expressed great\nsurprise at this announcement, and complained that his\neminence should thus, contrary to all diplomatic usages,\nhave left him in ignorance of a.,document which ought\nto have been communicated to him in the first instance.\nThe cardinal replied, You have only yourself to blame\nfor it, Count; did you not set the example of reserve\nand silence in the affair of the convention? Do not\ngive way to any uneasiness on the subject, however;\nour answer has been addressed to the universal epis-\ncopacy, and not to the cabinets.

It\nappeared that a large block of marble had been cut up\nInto slabs, and the unfortunate man was engaged in\nmoving them, when six or seven of the slabs weighing,\nit io stated, nearly two tons, fell on him. Upon exami-\nmtion it was discovered that he had sustained some\nsevere contusions of the right hip. Considering the I\nweight of the stones that fell on the unfortunate man it\nis a fortunate thing that none of his bones were broken.\n","362715":"COLLIERY ACCIDENT NEAR WIGAN.\n\nA colliery accident, one of the most appalling that has\never occurred in the district, took place early on Wed-\nnesday morning at the Douglas Bank Colliery, Wigan,\nof which Mr. Grant Morriss, of Liverpool, is the pro-\nprietor. It consists of a couple of shafts only a few\ndozen yards apart, both of which run through a valu-\nable series of coal beds, the chief of which are the\nPember.on five feet, the Pemberton feet, and the\ncannel. This latter lies about 500 yards from the\nsurface, and in one of these two shafts\u2014that in which\nthe accident occurred\u2014the sinking to this important\nseam has progressed so favourably that but some half\ndozen yards of rubbish remained to be sent up and the\nlabours of the sinkers would have been ended. Between\n8 and 9 o'clock on Wednesday morning a party of a\ndozen men were at work in the shaft in question, when\nit was found necessary to blast a portion of the strata\nthrough which they were passing. Two-thirds of the\nworkmen were hoisted to the surface, where they were\njoined in a few moments by their companions as soon\nas they had set fire to the fuze which was to light the\npowder. The blasting seemed to take place in a proper\nmanner below, and at ten minutes to nine a party of\neight men were again lowered. The engineer was,\nhowever, astonished to find that the hoppet containing\n- ?Lit,\n,men stopped in the shaft when it was still a few\nyardi\n;',.\nthe bottom, and he was still further sur-\nprised to not e the rope swaying to and fro in the pit.\nA shout down t' nit elicited no response, and the alarm\nbecame general wh.o it was found that it was impos-\nsible even with the ti\nted strength of two engines of\nvast power to move the\nBryham the manager, an 2ther\nth2.pipset from its position. Mr.\napprised na\nof the accident, and ha.. 74 gentlemen weris\nned to t bre,\nwhere measures were soon taken team the\ntrue state of affairs below. A new rope had\nto be placed on the drum, it being found impossible\nto move the five hundred yards then in the\nshaft. By noon this was accomplished, and a hoppet\nhaving been attached to the new rope the foreman of\nthe sinkers and a couple of assistants descended the\npit to learn the fate of those below. They reported\nthat the whole of the last range of brickwork-13\nyards deep, and running entirely round the shaft, 16\nyards in diameter\u2014had fallen to the bottom, burying\ncompletely the hoppet and the men in it. Eight active\nworkmen were at once sent down, and load after load\nof debris were sent up, and after great labour succeeded\nin reaching the hoppet with the men, five of whom\nwere found to be dead, and three alive in the hoppet,\nnot much injured.\n\nTHE YEAR 1864.\n\nThe year 1864 opened with a stormy aspect for\nEurope generally, while in America there was no pros-\npect of peace. In Denmark it was clear that there\nwould presently be an invasion of the Duchies. Poland\nwas in the depths\u2014not of despair, for the Poles never\ndespair\u2014but of ruin. The Emperor of the French was\nin his balancing mood; and there was no saying what\nhe would ain about adhering to the Treaty of 1852, or\nanything else. We were in dread of evil tidings from\nvarious quarters. The little war on the north west\nfrontier of India was more serious than we had\nsupposed; and Lord Elgin's death had left the\ncountry without a ruler at a most critical time.\nThe consolation was that Sir John Lawrence was\non his way out. The New Zealand war had\nassumed a very grave appearance; and we were in sue-\nTense about what would happen in Japan after the\n--affisir of Kagosima. As for the end of these uncer-\ntainties\u2014the little war in India was soon at an end\u2014to\nbe succeeded by another on another part of our frontier.\n.Beyond the Punjaub everything is settled for the pre-\nssen ; but we have a quarrel with Bhootan, in every\nway vexatious. The New Zealand war was supposed\n.\u2022 to be over in August; but fresh menaces have arisen,\nand-we.are not much happier about that colony at the\n. close of the year than we were at the beginning. In\n\u201ejapan, the affair of Kagosima seemed rather to tend\nto peace than the contrary; but new troubles\nare always arising there when everything seems to\nbe settled; And we hardly feel more secure of a\ngood. footing and a prosperous commerce now than\nwe did twelve months ago. In China the change\nAtas been more essentOhan we expected. The taking\n\u2022 .of Nanking in July; and the breaking of the heart of\nthe rebellion by that achievement, has afforded us the\nproper opportunity for determining what we shall do,\n\u2022 and what we shall abstain from doing, in regard to the\ndifficullies of half-barbarous countries line China,\nwhen their inevitable fate overtakes them. We had\ndeclined interference in Mexico, and the procession of\nevents there has satisfied us with our decision. We\nhave seen the French occupation becoming fear-\nfully costly in all ways: we have s.len the new\n.Emperor entering the country and the capied\namidst acclamations; we have seen him doing all\nthat was possible towards bringing Mexico into a\ncondition to be well governed, and we find in Pre-\nsident Lincoln's recent message that \"the civil\n\"war in Mexico still continues.\" We were full of pity\nfor St. Domingo when the year opened, and so we are\nnow; but the inhabitants have continued their resist-\nance till they seem likely to see the Spaniards sail away\nhomewards as their nesghbours, the Haytians, saw the\nFrench depart on a similar occasion. Spain has com-\nmitted other aggressions in that hemisphere during the\nyear; but they are so sure of their retribution that they\noccasion little anxiety to any but the parties immediately\nconcerned. As for the American conflict, we felt our-\nselves able to wait quietly for the issue. There seemed\nto bean end of solicitations to us to interfere; and the\ndistress in Lancashire was so far mitigated, and the\nprospects of a supply of cotton so far improved, that no\nexcuse was left for any importunity about intervention.\nSuch was the aspect of affairs when the sun rose clear\non New-Year's Day. That brilliant day was made all\nthe brighter to Europe by the pacific tone of the French\nEmperor's oracular utterances to the diplomatic visitors\nat the Tuileries. In a few days the weather grew fear-\nfully cold, inflicting intense suffering on the poor, and\ndeath on the aged and feeble. By degrees, too, clouds\nsettled down on the Imperial mind and countenance;\nand the prospects of Europe were as dark as they have\nbeen for many years. The Prince of August enburg had\nbeen proclaimed at Kiel at the close of the past year;\nno efforts made at Copenhagen to avert a collision were\ntreated with common patience or courtesy; and the\nfirst gunshot of the war between Denmark and the\nGerman Powers was fired on the 31st of January.\nBefore the middle of February Austria had repudiated\nthe treaty by which she had pledged herself to abide;\nand the embarrassment of the situation became extreme\nto the parties to the treaty who were other than Ger-\nmen. In this country the expectation of war was\nvery prevalent\u2014as it Would have been in\nFrance and Russia if the popular interest in\npolities had been anything like what it is with us.\nSince the Ministry were absolved by the critical vote of\nthe Commons on their foreign policy on the Bth of July,\nwe have at I.s:est known what to discuss, and have been\nfree to compare all the ideas which can exist under the\nterm non-intervention.; and thus, by the passing\nalarm of war we may have become better prepared to\nmeet or decline it, on the next critical occasion.\nDuring the months over which the uncertainty ex-\ntended, we witnessed the mournful spectacle of the\ninvasion and dismemberment of Denmark, and the yet\nmore painful manifestation of the worst points of the\nGerman national character. We have seen the consti-\ntutional prospects of Prussia overclouded or destroyed,\nand the dignity of Austria fatally impaired, while the\noutrageous violence of the Minister and the King of\nPrussia carried all before it.\n\nThe Polish insurrection went out with the hanging\n\u2022 of the chiefs of the National Government early in\nAugust; and the vengeance of Russia has had free\ncaurse ever since. The exodus of the Circassians' after\ntheir defence of their country against Russia for so\nmany years, has pained the world's heart\u2014the move-\nment being to the sufferers a concentration of famine\nancipestilence. Tens of thousands of the exiles did not\nwander long, but lay down to die wherever they might\n,be. The Arabs, again, have been showing that they\nare less satisfied or subdued under their rulers at Algiers\nand Tunis than had been supposed; and there has been\nmuch of the scattering warfare which characteripp\n. Northern Africa. We have witnessed the issii\nmore manifesto from Rome against 14.-\nof one\n..a\nknowledge and the development of progress of\nhave felt the effect of the Pope' philosophy, and\n.\nsuppression of the most lib admonition in the\nCatholic organs in this co\" and promising of\nclosing months of the\n- .ntry. And, through the\n.\nbearing of the .I.tal'- ,ear, we have watched the\n-he ope- ians, and especially the Piedmontese,\nundei ation of the Convention of September\n15. The riots at Turin were a melancholy spectacle;\nbut it presently became known that they were a sort of\n\u2022 accident, caused by folly and imprudence, and they\nwere soon forgotten in the nobleness of what followed.\nIn Ametica the aspect of affairs has been not less painful\nas the year has advanced. The war has been prose-\ncuted with unabated vigour, but, notwitbStanding\nrecent successess, with no decisive result. The re-election\nof Mr. Lincoln as President by an overwhelming\nmajority proves that the ,population of the Federal\nStates is still hopeful and resolute in its determination\n\nto reconquer the South. On the other band, the\nConfederates are still unanimously pledged to maintain\nthe independence which they have for more than three\n_ _ _ . . _ _\n\nyears deiended vith a heroin almost unparallelled in\n\nhistory.\nOn the Ist of June the Greek flag was hung out at\nCorfu. We had 3 ielded up the lonian Islands to the\nState to which they desired to belong.; and it was a\nmore blessed day to our country than if it had marked\nthe annexation of new territory. In the middle of July\nthe fii st intimation was made in Canada of the project\nof a Federal Union of our North American provinces,\nwhich has since made such progress as to constitute the\n. . . _\n\n_\nmost important feature of th_ e British policy of the\nyear. In India there has been much good work done,\n' under the rule of Sir John Lawrence, and foremost\namong his good works stands his rescue from death of\nthousands of \u2022 British soldiers and civilians, and of\nnatives, by a stirring bedinning of sanitary reform.\nAmidst serious calamity\u2014such as the hurricane and in-\nundation along the eastern coast, and the apprehended\nfamine from drought, already felt in its beginnings\u2014\nthe prosperity of India has been marvellous, and the\ndevelopment of its wealth beyond all the estimates of\nits rulers. As for the rest, we have made same mis-\ntakes; as, for instance, in the little Ashantee war,\nwhich cost some hundreds of precious lives by bad\n.weather and fever. We have been roughly spoken of\nand unceremoniously used in our Australian colonies;\nbut this happened while conciliatory despatches on the\nconvict question were on the way ; and the altercatten\nmay be considered at an end.\nThe d-tys of Garibaldi's short visit to England in\nApril will stand out in the history of thousands of lives\nas a great festival of the emotions; and the unfortuna.e\nmisunderstanding about the causes of his departure\nwhich spoiled some of the pleasure, and impaired some\u2022\nof the memory it, will, from their nature, be soon for-\ngotten, if they are not already. The day after he dis-\nappeared front the public eye we were celebrating the\nthree huedredth birthcLy of our own greatest man; but\nthe festival was not so well worth remembering as those .\nin which Garib dal was the object of honbur. Though\nearnest and generous efforts were made by individuals\nand groups of ci,izens all over the country\u2014and espe-\ncially at Stratford-on Avon\u2014the 23rd of April was not\na festival day thi oughout toe country, -while it yielded\nso little honour to our Shakespeare that we are probalilv\nall very ready to forget as much of it as we can. The\nWimbledon meeting of Volunteers was the most sue.\n\u2022cessful yet held\u2014a really glorious gathering of the\n.citizen soldiery who have undertaken a large share of\nthe defence of the country; and there wouid have been\nno drawback, but that by an accident a man was bhot.\nThe British Association for the Advancement of\nScience met at Bah in the middle of September,\nWe need not relate how the returned African explorers\nwere the most prominent attraction, nor how eager the\npeers and commoners o; the kingdom of science were to\nhear Capt in Seeke's account of his doings at the sources\nof the Nile; nor whit a dismay fell upon us all when a\nmovemeht of his own gun had silenced him for ever.\nThe Social Science Meeting was a good one for the\ntransa; tion of much useful business, but somewhat dull\nin comparison with tortner years. Tee Agricultural\nmeetings of the autumn were of unusual int4rest, for\ntwo reasons among others. They marked the progress\nof steam tillage, on which the future of the landed\ninterest now largely depends; and they afforded means\n. for consultation among the owners of all kinds of stock '\n\n' about how to feed cattle, horses, and sheep, through the\nwinter and spring\u2014the ordinary resources being cut off\nby the summer succeeding the cold weather of the spring.\nThe harvest, as far as wheat and barley went, was\nadmirable. We need not describe how it was with the\nhay, the pastures, and the roots. We shall feel- the\ntruth long in the price of meat and dairy produce. Then\ncame the autumn storms, and the terrible catalogue of\nwrecks in the great gales in\n.November. Few years\npresent such an array of calamities as has passed before\nthe eyes of residents on our eastern coasts within the\nlast quarter of the year. The accidents of all kinds\nhave indeed been very disastrous\u2014as the bursting of the\nreservoir near Sheffield in March, the railway accidents\nto the Ascot train in June, to the Darlington- train in\nJuly, the collision at Bradford in September, and those\nat Blackheath and Pringbourne ; the-ferryboat accident\nat Glasgow, which destroyed nineteen lives; and the\nfires which have cost us the Savoy Chapel and Haber-\ndashers' Hall, with its antiquarian treasures; besides\nthe Limehouse conflagration, and the explosion in the\nPlumstead Marshes. The horrible railway accident in\nCanada, which destroyed a wholeeompany of emigrants,\nand the cyclone at Calcutta seem to belong to our\nexperience, as they happened within the bounds of our\nempire.\n\nkanufacture and trade have flourished, generally\nspeaking; and every incident which draws attention\nto the fortunes of the working classes shows that those\nclasses understand better and better how to obtain the\nthe full advantage of their earnings. In two years no\nless than two mi lions sterling have been deposited in.\nthe Post-office Savings Bank: the same amount is in-\nvested in co-operative associations; and some of the\nlegislation of last session\u2014as the Government Annuities\nAct\u2014will prove a great help in enabling the labouring\nclasses to become capitalists in their degree, and to\nobtain the same advantages from such money as they\nhave as richer men can command. The increase of\nWorking Men's Clubs, and the Industrial Exhibitions\nwhich have been so prominent in the last few months,\nare influences tending in the same direction. The state\nof the cotton market, through the notion of speculators,\nhas disastrously prolonged the suffering of the Lan-\ncashire operatives, and renewed their hardships on the\napproach of Winter; but they have turned so readily to\nother employments, and their interests have been so\nwell managed, that there can now be no doubt of their\nbeing safely carried through till the fast increasing\nsupply of cotton shall restore them to their old way of\nlife. The strikes of the Staffordshire and the Yorkshire\ncolliers, and the riots at Belfast are the domestic\ngrievances of the year. Those riots happened when the\nlate Viceroy was prostrated by fatal illness. His suc-\ncessor has entered upon office while the shame of the\nBelfast outrages was fresh, and when tte people\nof Ireland were beginning to be cheered by the return\nof good seasons, and a prosperous agricultural year.\nThe most distinct aspect shown by the- government\nand legislation of the country has been its- provisional\ncharacter. The interval has been more or less vigo-\nrously used this year in preparation for sustained enter-\nprise when the time shall come. There are to be\nreforms in the law, and reforms in the representation;\nand the Church is in a state of positive commotion about\nthe schemes over which its parties will struggle and\nstrive. This is one of the marked features of the year\nwhich we are leaving behind. In one of the proposed\nenterprises some progress has been actually made.\nNot only has a Royal Commission reported on our\ngreat public schools, but another Royal Commission\nhas been appointed to consider the whole eubjeet of\nmiddle-class educetion.\nThe Queen and her family have had their ex-\nperiences sweet and bitter, like the rest of us. Three\ngrandchildren have been born to the Queen\u2014our own\nfuture Prince of Wales, one at Berlin, and one at\nDarmstadt. Oar little Prince was born untimely into\ninto a cold-and then troubled world; but the warmth of\nthe national welcome was all the more fervid. His\nDanish mother has had all possible sympathy from the\ncountry generally; and her husband and she were\nfollowed with eager interest in their visits to her parents,\nand to the Royal Family of Sweden. The Queen and\nher children have made more than the usual journeyings\nto Balmoral and Osborne; and it was gratifying to the\nwhole country, as well as to the people of Perth, that\nshe found herself able to attend at the unveiling of the\nstatue-of- the Prince Consort in that city, in August.\nMuch was hoped from this ; audit more has-not followed,\nthere has been some relaxation since last year\u2014some\nfew guests admitted, and somewhat more oP intercourse\nwith the world outside. The Prince and Princess of\nWales have held levees and drawing rooms, and have\npaid ,a memorable visit to Cambridge University, and\nattended reviews, and enjcyed at Sandringham the\ndomestic repose so well earned. While the continental\ndespots have been circling about in Europe, like flies in\nthe air, as if for the purpose of encountering or avoiding\neach other, it was felt everywhere that the Queen of\nEngland could not go to Germany this year. Almost\nall the continental Sovereigns and their Prune-Ministers\nhave met, at various times and places; but Englalid\ndoes not want to enter into their counsele, under the\npresent aspect of affairs;. and the only represene,ative of\nour Royal Family has been Prince Alfred,\nwhere he received the Order of the 'ee at Berlin\neataek Eagle.\nIt has been a year of much sick unusual\n',\nmortality; and this appears in the!le-eag list of deaths of\nand:eeminent as well as common or\n'unknown men. Every-\nbody's first thought will be e\n, oi the two statesmen whom.\nold men little thought\ncastle and the Earl ) survive, the Duke of New-\n'of Carlisle. The Church has lost\ntwo Bishops\u2014 7e\nTurton,. of Ely, and Da.vys of\nPeterboroe `\nJoin The Navy has lost two Admirals\u2014Gage\nand R-\n-1 ,etimarea. Among the peers, two Dukes of Cleve-\naud have died within eight months of each other. The\npeerage of the Earls of Clare has become extinct. The\nDuke of Athole and the Earl of Aberdeen have died in\nmiddle life; and Lord Ashburton before he was old.\nFrom the House of Commons Mr. Spooner will be\nmissed. Among political agitators that too Cervantie\nhero Smith O'Brien must be first, in whatever year he\ndied; but there was also the sound and sensible William\nJohnson-Fox, member for Oldham. The lawyers have\nlost Sir William Atherton, late Attorney-General, and,\nSerjeants Merewethers and Stephen. In philosophy\nand science we feel the loss, not only of our Professor\nFerrier and Leonard Horner, but of the greater Struve,..\nthe Russian, and Sdliman the American. Pere-\nEnfantin, sometime chief of the St. Sineonian brother-\nhood, should rank with ardent workers whose work is-\ndone. With our own, lamented traveller and discoverer,\nCaptain Speke, we may remember Jules Gerard, who.\nhadhis own merits as an African traveller. In litera-\nture we have lost Walter Savage Landor, the poor poet\nClare Alaric Watts, Lucy Aikin, Catherine Sinclair,\nF. E. Smedley, and T. Colley Grattan, Adelaide A.\nProctor and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Colonel Torrens\nand M'Cullooh, busy men in the early days of political\neconomy, have died out in a good old age. George\nDaniel and C. Winston, Mr. Dan, Prof. Pillans, and\nNesseu W. Senior, have also left us during the year.\nOf actors we have lost Frederick Robson, and the\ngallant veteran, T. P. Cooke. In muse, M -yerbeer is\nthe world's loss, in which we share. Poor Behnes, the\nsculptor, in leaving his life of trouble, recalled many\nmemories of old achievements. Of painters, we have\nlost Dyce, and W. H. Hunt, David Roberts, and Lance,\nthe President of the Scottish Academy; Sir John\nWatson Gordon and John Leech.\n\nAUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, AND JAPAN.\u2014 The\nanti transportation movement is being. energetically\nprosecuted in Australia. The latest advices from New\nZealand mention no event of importance. The natives,\nwho were still in rebellion, were making preparations\nfor a renewal of the struggle. There is nothing of\nimportance from Japan. Sir Rutherford Alcock was\nexpected to return to England by the next mail.\nTim POPE'S ALLOCUTION.\u2014On December 26 the\nPope received the members of the Sacred College and\naadressed to them an Allocution, in which he said that\nin the present day robbery was committed under the\npretext of nationality. The triumph of the Church\nwas certain, the day only of that triumph being un-\ncertain. His holiness added that after witnessing the\ndestruction of the enemies of the Holy See and the\ntriumph of truth and virtue, he would exclaim with\nSimon, \"Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depar t in\npeace.\" All the foreign Amba.sadors, including Baron\nvon Meyendorff, have each had a separate audience of\nthe Pope. The Pope, in receiving the homage, the\ncongratualtions, and sentiments ot devotion presented\nby General de Montebello in the name of the French\narmy of occupation, said :\u2014\" Similar sentiments of the\nFrench army were manifested to me at Gaeta by a\nGeneral who is ow a Marshal, and subsequently by\nall the other Generals who have commanded the French\narmy, and who generously hastened to oefend the\nEternal City. I have always prayed for this army, for\nhim who directs the destinies of France, for his good\nclergy, and for all French Catholics. At the present\ntime I shall not cease to pray for and bless the\nCatholic nation, the Emperor, the Empress, and the\nImperial family, that God may accord them all necessary\nenlightenment.\nLINCOLN CIATIIEDRAL.\u2014WOTIS of restoration at the\nwest front of Lincoln Cathedral are about to be pro-\nceeded with, under the advice of Mr. Buckler, of\nOxford, who has tseen employed for many years by the\nDean and Chapter. What is now being done is to\ncollect the remains of old columns, removed long since,\nand copy them in the minutest deta,l in Lincoln stone,\nthe original material, in order to replace the columns of\nYorkshire grit,\nand at the same time to put in fresh\npieces in those parts of the Norman doorway which are\nperishing from age, these\nParts being also copied with\nthe most minute accuracy. It is a peculiarity of the\nLincoln oolite to become coated with a bard surface\nwhich preserves it, and all that is done at Lincoln is to\nremove the black sooty matter by which this surface is\noverlaid. This is done by first wetting the stone with\nwater from a brush, and then taking off the black wirh\na small tool, without either mallet or hammer, the tool-\nmarks of the old Norman workmen being left. Not\neven this process has been or will be applied to curious\nNorman carvings.\n\nFRIGHTFUL RAILWAY ACCIDENT.\n\nA most dreadful accident, attended with\" loss of life,\noccurred on the night of December 15,. shortly before 8\no'clock, on the Grand Trunk Railroad, about a mile and\na half west of the Detroit and Milwaukee junction,\nthrough a collision between the day- passiuger express\nwest and a freight train going east. The passenger\nI train was behind time and had made all the necessary\npasses, according to the telegraphic instruction, until it\nhad passed New Baltimore \u2022station, where, it is said,\nit had orders to cross the freight going east of the\nDetroit and Milwaukee junction. When it arrived\nthere, according to the story of the operator at the\nGrand Trunk Junction, it had orders' to proceed all\n:right. Under these instructions it passed the\n_junc-\ntion, when shortly afterwards the engineer thought\nhe discovered an engine ahead. The next moment\nhe heard the whistle to down breaks, when he imme-\ndiately gave a similar order and reversed-` his- engine.\nThere were with him in the cab at the time\ntwo other persons besides the fireman. Before they\ncould jump the two engines came crashing together in\nfrightful contact, literally making chaos of everything\nconnected with both. The engines were dovetailed\ninto each other in an inseparable manner, and the snail\nand baggage car of the passenger train driven partially\nthrough the forward passenger car, thereby causing the\nfrightful catastrophe which followed. The passenger\ntrain, which consisted only of two coaches and a bag.gaae car, was crowded-with passengers. Both cars were\nfilled to the utmost, so much so that scarcely even\nstanding room could be obtained. After the accident\nthose in the forward car who were not helplemly\ninjured endeavoured to get out as somas possible. It\nis said, and we give it upon the authority of one of the\npassengers that the baggage man, who, it appears had\ncharge of the train\u2014there being no conductor aboard\u2014\nor one of the breaksmen, shut the hind door of the car,\nand would not for some time allow the passengers egress,\nstating that there- was no danger. Immediately aftet\nthe smash occurred the stoves were up-et and the cars\ntook fire. In an almost incredible spice of time the flames\nenveloped the whole, with the exception of the last car,\nand how many perished time alone can tell. After re-\ncovering from the shock those who escaped turned their\nattentions to the rescue of those in danger, and suc-\nceeded in delivering several from the burning mass.\nWhile thus engagi-d they were forced to witness a sight\nwhich fairly curdled the blood in their veins, and to-\nwards the recital of which the pen denies its office. The\nmail agent,George W. Millen, from Port Huron, was\nfound to be jammed in between the baggage and for-\nward passenger car. His leg wart firmly held between\ntwo pieces of 'broken timber, and all efforts to rescue\nhim before the devouring flames etigulphed him in their\nfolds proved futile. The most herculean efforts to\nextricate his crushed and bleeding limbs were used,\nbut the rapidly spreading flames drove the labourers\nfrom their work, and they were faced to witness, him\nperish before their eyes, his heartrendering shrieks for\nhelp piercing their ears, until stifled amid the smoke\nand flames of the devouring element. God of Heaven, it\nwas a sickening eight, and completely enervated the\nenergies of those around in their duty to others pro-\nbably equally terribly situated. After thefire had burnt\ndown his charred trunk was taken from the-\nruine, the head, arms,. and legs completely devoured,.\nand the body roasted to a cinder. As we.\nhave stated, it is not known how many persons\nperished. We can, therefore, only as yet surmise the.\nnumber sacrificed to the catastrophe. Bome persons in\nworking among the ruins discevered a portion of a\nwomanra hoop skirt, and shortly afterwards-the bones off\na human being among the ashes. Another person drew\nfrom the ruins a portion of the bottom of a' silk dress,\nand a ticket, upon which was the address \"'Miss Mary\nBoorlingham, Oneida, N.. Y.\" But whether this\nbelonged to any one who. perished has not yet bees\ndiscovered.. It is said that a' lady and two children were\nin the oar, who have not turned up, and that a physician\nwho was in the city, awaiting the arrival of a- sister, or\nsome female relative, or both, mourns their absence.\nIt is probable that five on- six- have perished. Beyond\nthe melancholy death of Mr. Millen no other names\nhave transpired. The names-of the wounded, so far as\noould be ascertained, together with the nature of their\ninjuries, areas follows:\u2014Mr. Davidson, express agent,\nDetroit, head and face severely ;.a family named Ashley,.\nfor North Danforth, Massachusetts, consisting of a\nmother, son, and daughter, were more or less- injured.\nThe mother was severely injured about the head and\nface, and the son, it is ftured, is injured internally. He\nwas completely bewildered for some time. The\ndaughter, Mary,. had her arm. broken and- her leg\nseverely bruieed,.and appeared to be suffering intense\npain. They were on their way to Wisconsin, where-\nthey intended to- settle. Mr. Watson, a gentleman\nfrom Canada, internally, so badly as to be unable to\ngive an-account\nhis residence and friend&. A special\ntr.a4.ii left the central depot ,out 10 for the pur-\nPose of removing, the sufferers to the city. Or:jog to\nthe obstructions on the track only those who were acla\nto walk returned by it. Another special, however, was\ndespatched over the southern road to remove those\nwhose injuries- required careful handling. They were\nall brought in at a late hour, and their aufferings as\nkindly administered to as was possible under the cir-\ncumstances. The majority of them are strangers in ea\nstrange land, and should receive the kindest treatment,\nfrom our citizens. It is almost needless-to say that all\ntheir baggage was destroyed, which to several is an..\nirreparable loss. The mails-were also burnt, with the\nexception of slew- letters.\u2014,Detroit Free Russ.\n\nA RURGLA-It\u2022 CAPTURED AT BRIGHTON.\u2014A determined\nlooking fellow, who gave the name of Edward Marriott,\nand his age and residence as \"nowhere\" was charged\nat the Brighton police court, on January 3, with having\nattempted to .commit a burglary at the workshop of Mr.\nBright, a jeweller, in Castle square. In consequence\u2022of\nhaving lost a considerable amount of property twelve\nmonths since, Mr. Bright employed a night watchman\nnamed John Hawkins. About one o'clook a.m. Hawkins\nheard a noise, and secreted himself, Presently he\nobserved a,man pass from the leads of the School ot\nArt, which adjoins, on to the leads-of the workshop.\nThis depredator was followed by a. second, and then\nsomething was handed to them from the roof of the\nSchool of Art by a third accomplice. At this point\nHawkinsse;red the first man with his left hand, and,\npointing a pistol at one of ,the others, threatened to fire\nif he did not surrender. He followed up the threat by\nactually discharging the weapon, and one of the burglars\ncried out, \"I am shot. I'll surrender.\" But instead\nof doing so he and the third man, effected their escape.\nThe men whom Hawkins caught was held by him until\nthe police arrived. He was brought up before the\nmagistrates as stated, and by them remanded.\nTHE BANKRUPTCY OF STRAILLN, PAUL, AND. BATES.\u2014\nThis case has been frequently before the Court of\nBankruptcy, and January 3 was. fixed for a dividend\nmeeting. The total debts proved were \u00a34,46,778, and\na further dividend of 6d. in. the pound was ordered to\nbe paid, making a total of 4s. Bd. There- still remains\nin. hand of the assignee, \u00a33,203, and 414,000 more is\nexpected very shortly from the French. Government,\nupon receipt of which a. further dividend will be\ndeclared.\n\nDEATH OE SIR ALEXANDER BANNERMAN.\u2014InteIIi,\ngence has been received of the decease of Sir A.\nBannerman, Knight, who in 1857 was appointed to the\nchief command of the colony of Newfoundland. The\nancestors of deceased, who was cousin of Sir Alexander\nBannerman, Bart., were hereditary banner bearers of\nthe Kings of Scotland, in the tenth and eleventh\ncenturies. Born in 1783, his earlier years were passed\nin mercantile pursuits, and for some years he was a\nshipowner, merchant, and banker at Aberdeen, of which\ncity he was ultimately elected pi ovost. After the passing\nof the Reform Bill he was elee ad member for Aberdeen,\nwhich he continued to represent without interruption\ntill 1847. In 1837 he was elected Dean of Marischal\nCollege' and in 1851 he was nominated by Earl Grey,\nunder Lord John Russell's administration, to the\nGovernorship of Prince Edward's Island, when he\nreceived the honour of knighthood. He remained three\nyears in his post, which was afterwards exchanged for\nthe Governorship of the Bahamas, and three years sub-\nsequently, he was appointed to the chief command in the\ncolony of Newfoundland.\nROYAL SHOOTING PARTY.\u2014On January 3 their Royal\nHighnesses the Count de Paris, the Duo de Chartres,\nand another member of the ex-Royal family of Orleans,\nvisited Windsor Great Park, for the purpose of enjoying\na day's shooting among the well-stocked coverts and\npreserves of the Royal demesne. Every precaution had\nbeen taxen by the keepers to ensure plenty of game.\nThe Princes reached the Park about 11 o'clock, and were\nmet by Major-General Seymour, the deput3 -ranger, the\nparty being also joined by Lieut.\u2022 Colonel Marsh al, of\nthe 2nd Life Guards. Mr. Cole, the head keeper' as-\nsisted by a number of keepers and beaters, had charge\nof the proceedings, the sport being commenced in the\npreserves near Cumberland Lodge. Thence the Royal\nsportsmen shot over the covert on the right of the road\nleading to Virginia Water, a large number of pheasants\nand rabbits (hares being extremely scarce here) falling\nbefore the guns of the party. The best of the sport,\nhowever, was found in the large covert on the left of\nthe Obelisk drive, which was next explored with the\nmost favourable results. Along this drive the distin-\n\u2022 guished party, with a long line of keepers, advanced\nSlowly along the dry fern, driving the game, which\nevery moment offered first\u2022rate hits, in front of them.\nOne of the Royal game vans followed in the track of\nthe shooting party, whose success by half-past two\no'clock\u2014three hours and a half\u2014mounted up to over\n300 head, double barrelled breech loaders having been\nused by most of the party. Their Royal. Highnesses\nthen proceeded to the Royal fishing temple on the banks\nof Virginia Water, where a splendid luncheon had been\nprovided from Windsor Castle. The lake itself WWI\npat tly frozen, being covered with a thin coating of ice,\nbut not strong enough to bear skaters. After partaking\nof luncheon, the guests took their departure, having\ntifidently enjoyed an excellent day's sport.\n\nMR. GLADSTONE ON COAL RESOURCES\n\nMT. Henry Beckett, F.G.S., of Wolverhampton,\nrecently delivered a lecture in the Assembly Room,\nMold, on \"Geology in its application to the coalfields\nof North Wales.\" Sir S,ephen Glynn\u00b0 presidea. The\nRight. Hon. the Chancalor of the Exchequer was pre-\nsent, and moved a vote of thanks to the lecturer. He\ncongratulated the audience on the justice which Mr.\nBeckett had done to the,aealfield. ot Flintshire, stating\nAbet .he (Mr. Gladstone) was not satisfied with the\ntreatment which that coaifield had received in a variety\nof putilicltions. It had been assumed that because that\nwas an old coal-mini g di\u2022trict\u2014a district where for a\nlong period of time their forefathers:had been scratch-\ning and grubbing, es it were, the surface of the earth\u2014\nthe coals theie were exhausted, and there was no more\noccasion to think about them except just by way of\ngathering up some scraps and leavings which those who\n\u2022came before thent-hail not heen-able to extract from the\nbowels ot mother earth; but he himself had cherished\na hope, which had strengthened\n\u2022from year to year\nand which was now coming to a state of great\nconfidence and vigour, that it might likewise be\nconsidered as a Tory young coal\u2022mining district\u2014that\nit was a district to the real character of which people\nwere only just beginning really to awaken. \u2022 He\nthought the signs baet already appeared that this was a\ntrue conclusion, and he confidently looked for the\nmultiplication of thosa \u2022 signs from year to year. The\ngeneral rule in that district had been in former timas to\nstop at the main coal. It was assumed, for some reason\nor other, that that was the ne plus witra, the very\nfurthestpoint downwards of the coal measures, and the\nworkings in any seams under the main coal had been\nvery insignificant. But when they came to compare\nwhat had taken place in adjoining districts\u2014going, for\nexample down the bend of the Dee to the extreme of\nthe estuary\u2014they found great clusters of coal measures\u2022\ncropping up at different points, and it had never been\nproved yet that the whole of those coal measnr(s\nwere not lying undisturbed and tranquil under\nthe main coal, waiting to be dug up. It .was a\ndistrict in which they might hope that before\nlong deep shafts would be brought into operation.\nThey had now every reason to believe that the\ncoalfield of that district passed under the estuary\nof the Dee and connected itself with the Lancashire\ncoalfield ; and he was sanguine enough to believe that\nthe day was not far distant when the estuary of the\nDee, which now meant a vast surface lying almost\nuseless, would be recovered from the usurpation of the\nsea and brought under cultivation, while the mineral\nenterprise of this great country was at work under-\nneath. Referring to some observations by the lecturer\non the dismal prognostications supposed to have been\nwade by Sir William Armstrong in regard to the\nprobable exhaustion of the coal supply of this country,\nMr. Gladstone said he had been told that in those\nspeculations Sir William Armstrong referred simply to\nthe district within which he spoke. He hoped that\n200 years were not to see the exhaustion of the\nmineral wealth of England, for\u2014having, immense\nconfidence in the resources of this country as well\nas lea the character of the people, which under\nGod was the best of all its resources\u2014he did think that\nthere was nothing certainly which he for one should\ncontemplate with such apprehension as the exhaustion\nof its mineral wealth,. and especially of its supplies of ,\ncoal. He backed Sir William Arnastrong's recom-\nmendation of economy in the use of coal; and he- could\nnot help mentioning that a very intelligent gentleman\nhad informed him that they were cheapening gas at\nsuch a rate that it was-highly probable that after the\nlapse of a few years all houses occupied by the labour-\ning part of the populationin particular would use no\ncoal at all, but would have all the functions of light,\nwarmth, and cooking performed by gas. This opened\nai most unportant source of economy to the working\nclasses,, 'while it also indicated a hope that we\nmight be- permitted to, economise- our stores- of\ncoal, and, at the same time see removed.ithat which was\nlike a great blot on the face of creation\u2014namely, the\nmass of smoke which disfigured large districts of this\ncountry.\n\nAn. inquest'has been held at the Holborn Union, on\nthe body of Annie Hanks, aged seven years. Deceased\ndied from the effects of her dress catching fire on Dec.\n4th,. in consequence of upsetting a penny paraffin lamp..\nA verdict a \"Accidental Death\" was returned.\n\nI WEAVING- BY COMERESBEED, Ain.--A new process of\nweaving by means of compressed air was shown on,\nSiturday to aosumber of scientific gentlemen and manu-\nfacturers, which appears destined to effect a complete\nrevolution in.the textile manufactures a this country.-\nThe loom, which was shown at work near the Swan..\nPier, Loudon bridge, possesses so many advantages over\nany of the existing looms that there can-be little doubt\nt!..e.t it will supersede those now in use-in the manu-\nfacturing districts. When it is stated that there are.\n_upwards of half a million of looms employed in this\nco-,!ntry, some idea may be forme4 or the extent of the\nchange whisk will undoubtedly be effected.

Redditch, and\nhis wife, are in custody upon the charge of seriously\nill-treating two of their children, and thereby causing\nthe death of one of them. Prosser and. his family, ea\nin number, have only resided in that district for a\nfoitnight, having been. engaged by a farmer. The man\nhad four children of his own, and the female prisoner,\nwho is his second wife, bad two other children who\nwera illegitimate. A. Mrs. Ann Thurstans, a neighbour,\nwho had visited the house several times, noticed that\nthe children were not properly cared for, and she had\nalso heard the wcman complain of the trouble they\ncaused her. On Saturday night she was called in to\nsea the child on which the inquest was held, when it\napueared to be very ill. Its stepmother, according to\nthe father's account, had \"given it a little slap or two,\nand it had fallen down.\" Mrs. Thurstans gave informa-\ntion to the man's employer, who communicated with\nthe police, and subsequently two children, boys, were\nremoved to the lodging-house, and placed under medical\ncare, but one of them sank from exhaustion, and died\non Monday morning. When. removed, the children\nwere dreadfully- emaciated, and bore several bruises.\nDeceased's arms and legs were contracted, the ex-\npression of the face .wild and idiotic, the surface of\nthe body covered with dirt, and the hair full of vermin.\nThe opinion of the surgeon, founded upon a post-\nmortem examination of the body, was that death had\nresulted from exhaustion, produced by want of food\nand from cold. The prisoners have been taken\nbefore a [magistrate and remanded. The other boy is\nin such a weak condition that his life is despaired of.\nThe neighbours are !erg indignant at the fact that\nwhile these two children were in such a\nstate of\nsuffering and disease, the two illegitimate children of\nthe woman appear to be strong, hearty, and well fed.\nNmv p\u201e,B.\u2014The Session of Parliament which is\nnow rapidly approaching will see several\nnew faces in\nboth I:louses. The familiar form of the Duke of New-\ncastle has passed away from the House of Lords, and\nhis place will be filled by his eldest son, the Earl of\nLincoln, who in past years was a well known member\nof the House of Commons. The Duke of Cleveland,\nwho enjoyed his honours but a few months, has also\nPassed away, and his seat will be filled by his brother,\nLord Harry Vane, a distinguished member of the Lower\nHouse, who occasionally took a prominent part in its\nproceedings, and who, it *ill be remembered, nominated\nthe present Speaker for his high office. The Earl of\nSuffolk.j ertY n the late\nViscount\nConservative\nCadogan died ou the 15th of Sept., and at the meeting\nof Parliament Viscount Chelsea, his eldest son,\nwho for some time represented the borough of\nDover, will be entitled to take his seat in the\nHouse of Lords.

The new Earl\nhas just attained his majority, having been born on the\n11th of June, 1843. His Royal Highness the late\nPrince Consort stood sponsor to him at his baptism.\nThe death of the Earl of Stair, which has recently\ntaken place, creates another vacancy in the House of\nLords, which will be supplied by Viscount Dalrymple,\nwho will succeed as Baron Oenford, of Cousland, in\nthe peerage of the United Kingdom, the earldom of\nStair being a Scotch peerage. Lord Manners died on\nthe 14th of November, causing a blank in the House of\nLords. It will remain a blank for the present, inas-\nmuch as the successor to the title was born on the 15th\nof May, 1852, and will not, therefore, reach his ma-\njority. until 1873. The death of Lord Rodney, who\ndied on the 19th of August, will also create a blank in\nthe House of Lords, which. cannot be filled up until\n1878, when his successor, the Hon. George Bridges\nDennett, his eldest son, will be of age. The Hon. and.\nRev. W. G. Howard, rector of Londesborough, York-\nshire, will be entitled to take his seat as successor to\nthe late Earl of Carlisle.\n\nAN \"ALICE GREY\" IN BIRMINGHAM.\n\nA curious case came before Messrs. T. Colmore and.\nA. Dixon at the Erdington Police- court on December 29.\nA \"lady of respectable appearance,\" aged 30, who gave\nher nawe as \" Mrs. Young,\" was charged with stewing\n\u00a3BO, the property of-Maria Holloway. The prosecutrix\nis tie mother of Mrs. Perrins, who is the wife of a\nbrush menufac; urer in Camden street, Birmingham but\nwho res des in the Victoria road, Aston. On Tuelay,\nthe 13th u t., a lady, dressed in black, called at the house\nof Mr. Terries, in the Victoria road. She SAW Mrs.\nPerrino, and stated that she wished to rent a house of\nher. Mrs. Perrins said that she could not go with her\nto show her over it, as shiewas without a servant. The\nlady replis d, \"I know a young person that would just\nsuit you. Sue is an orphan, and when oat of a situation\nlives with me. My name is Mrs. Youn' g and I live in\nAlma street.\" Mrs. Perrins said she would see her, and\nit wasarranged that the \"young person\" should come on\nSaturday morning. On that morning the prisoner, who\nwas the \"young person,\" came and agreed with Mrs.\nPerrins, and she en- ered on her duties on Saturday night.\nThe prisoner said. her name was \"Ann.\" All 'went well\non the Saturday night, and on the next day, Sunday.\nOn Monday morning Mrs. Perrins went out to co lect\nborne rents, leaving the prisoner and three children in\nthe house. So soon as Mrs. Perrins was gone out the\npri,ozier locked the three children ma room, as she sail\nat their mother's desire, and went up-stairs \"to do her\nwork.\" On Mrs. Perrin's return she was going up-\nstairs, when the prisoner told one of the children; to call\nher down, or the baby, who was poorly, would die.\nThis was done, and Mrs. Perrino came down again.\nThe prisoner then said she knew a lady in Philip street\nwho had some very nice goose oil, which she WAS stye\nwould do the chili good, and she would go and fetch;\nsome. She went, but forgot to return. In the mean-\ntime, Mrs. Perrins had gone upstairs, and disovered\nthat \u00a3BO, which beionged to her mother, and which she\nhad left safe in a drawer, was gone. She commuiiic tied\nwith the police, and search was made in Alma st: eat for'\nMrs. Young. The lady in black could not be dis-\ncovered; but a house was found shut up, but in the\npossession of a Mrs. Harvey. The police, having\ngood reason to believe that Mrs. Young and Mrs.\nHarvey were \" closely \" connected, followed up the\ntrack after Mrs. Harvey, and discovered that she was\nresiding in a house at Potter's Hill, Aston. Police\nSuperintendent Bloxham, accompanied by a police con-\nstable and Mrs. Berrins, went there on Monday last.\nMr. Blozham knocked at the door and a female came.\nHe stated who he was, and demanded admittance. The\nfemale replied that she would not open the door, and\nshe drew an extra bolt across it. Access was then\nobtained at a bedroom window. The prisoner was\ncovered in the kitchen sitting before the fire, on wh oh\n20 quantity of paper was smouldering. Only Ss. 10.71,41.\nin money was found in the 15itise, but a receipted bill\nfor \u00a34 Ils, was taken from the prisoner's person. It\nwas also afterwards ascertained that the prisoner had\npaid between LSO and \u00a34O to different tradesmen within\nthe last few days. The same prisoner was then charged\nwith stealing three suits of clothes, value \u00a35, the pro-\nperty of Eliza Partridge, Warwick street, Walsall, on\nthe 15th of May last. The prisoner came on the 12th\nof that month to lodge with the.prosecutrix, and left\non the 17th. On the 18th the goods were misse\nand information given to the police. A descrip-\ntion of the goods was sent round to all the pawn-\nbrokers in the district, but nothing was-heard of them.\nThe prisoner gave the name of Ann to-the prosecutrix,\nand she.being sent for when the prisoner was in custody\non the first charge, recognised her. She then con-\nfessed that two of the suits were at Mr. Smith's, pawn-\nbroker, Potter's hill, and the other suit was Miss Mack's\npawnbroker, Phillip. street. The police found them\nthere. ,The prisoner was committedto the ensuing War-\nwick sessions on both charges. Mr. Dixon said he\ncould not let the opportunity pass without severely\ncensuring the two pawnbrokers mentioned. If they,\nwhen the notices were sent out, had given up the\nclothes the case would have come on then, arid the\nprosecutrix in the first ease would, in all probability,\nhave been saved the etrious loss of a large sum of\nmoney. Since the prisoner's incarceration she has\nconfessed to Superintendent Bloxhara that \"Mrs.\nYoung\" and \"Ann\" were the same person. That\nby the means of false hair and teeth, and different\ndresses, the so disguised herself that when\nshe appeared before Mrs. Perrins as, \"Ann,\"\nand in propria persona, that lady did, not re-\ncognise her. She insists that she did not steal \u00a3BO\nbut \u00a32l. She also states that on one occasion when\nthe police were searching her house for a cash-box sh \u2022\nwas washingAndhadtheaash-box hidden at the bottom of\nthe \"jowl.' On another occasion when, she was wanted\nherself she hid under the- counter of a grocer's shop,\namongst thebacon and cheese. Her history is a most\nremarkable one. At the early age of 19 she was tried\nat Erdington, on the Idth of July, and, after com-\nmitment, was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment.\nIn 1853 she was again sentenced, at Birmingham, to\n10 years' penal servitude. This was afterwards com-\nmuted to eight months. A short time after she again\ncame out of prison she was tried again at Birmingham,\nand sentenced. to four years' penal seruitude,. which\nterm she served at Brixton, returning in 11159. When\nthe came back she got married to a gun-barrel forger,\nand lived with him a short time. Nothing has since\nbeen heard of her until within the last few months. She\nis stated to be wanted in Birmingham on some half-\ndozen charges, and the police have for some time been\non the look-out for her.\u2014Birminghain Post.\n\nLETTER 7Eol`+l THE GEAND DURE NICAOLA.S. - The\nJiroscow Gacctie publishes the following letter addressed\nby the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia to the military\ngovernor of Moscow :\u2014\" Florence, December 10\nMichel Andreievitch,..\u2014Your letter, by which you offer\nboth to me-and' my future wife your congratulations on\nthe occasion of our betrothals, did not reach me until\n.after my departure from Denmark.

Mr. Edwards\nhaving been heard for the prosecution, and Mr. Pope\nfor the defence, it was decided, without hearing wit-\nnesses, that there was no hope of a conviction, as there\nwas not sufficient evidence of any express trust,\nalthough, no doubt, if the facts were correctly stated,\nthere had been gross misappropriation.

The ambassador expressed great\nsurprise at this announcement, and complained that his\neminence should thus, contrary to all diplomatic usages,\nhave left him in ignorance of a.,document which ought\nto have been communicated to him in the first instance.\nThe cardinal replied, You have only yourself to blame\nfor it, Count; did you not set the example of reserve\nand silence in the affair of the convention? Do not\ngive way to any uneasiness on the subject, however;\nour answer has been addressed to the universal epis-\ncopacy, and not to the cabinets. Had it been sent to\nthe latter, you would have received it first; you know\nthat lam not so vindictive as to think of omitting you.'\nAs he smilingly uttered these words the cardinal pr e-\n;tented to the ambassador a printed copy of the encyclical\nletter with the documents accompanying it.\nACCIDENT AT MESSRS.

It\nappeared that a large block of marble had been cut up\nInto slabs, and the unfortunate man was engaged in\nmoving them, when six or seven of the slabs weighing,\nit io stated, nearly two tons, fell on him. Upon exami-\nmtion it was discovered that he had sustained some\nsevere contusions of the right hip. Considering the I\nweight of the stones that fell on the unfortunate man it\nis a fortunate thing that none of his bones were broken.\n","127939":"TWO HUNDRED AND TWO LIVES LOST.\n\nA dreadful calamity occurred on Monday at Ply-\nmouth, in Pennsylvania, in the coal region of A. von-\ndale. The colliery hid not been in use for some time\non account of the labourers being on strike, but they\nresumed work on Monday, when a shaft more than\n300 ft. deep caught fire at the bottom, from the ventilat-\ning furnace timbers being dry. In a few moments the\nentire shat and buildings above were in flames. The\nfire continued for some hours, and rubbish fell down\nand choked the shaft. Two hundred and two men and\nboys who were in the mine are believed to have been\nsuffocated. Access has not yet been got to them. Two\nmen sent dawn the shaft were immediately suffocated.\nGreat distress is tranifeited at the pit mouth, which is\nsurrounded by hundreds of weeping relations. Efforts\nhave been made to force air down the shaft by a steam\nfan. An attempt is also being made to effect an entrance\nto the colliery from an adjacent colliery by drilling a\nhole from one gallery to another.

Thus, not only\nwill the work be more cheaply performed than by civilian\nlabour, but a valuable corps of efficient constructors of tele-\ngraphs will be formed, which will be of the utmost ser-\nvice in any future campaign, to lay and maintain those\nficld telegraphs which must in future be essential con-\ncomitants of every combatant force in active service,\u2014\nGlobe.\n\nlOLENT DEA.TIS6.\u2014A violent or unnatural death\nseems a sad exit from the world; yet in England one\ndeath in every 28 is of this character. The proportion is\nincreasing; the deaths by violence in 10,003 of p )pul s-\ndon ranged from 7.16 to 7.60 in the four years 1851-51 ;\nfrom 7.95 to 8.35 in the four years 1861-67. There is\nno increase of death from murder, manslaughter, or\nsuicide, but in the deaths from accident or negligence\nthe increase is too manifest. In the five years 1863-67\n2,391,165 deaths were registered in England and Wales,\nwith the causes of death specified ; and of 83,853, the deaths\nof 62,708 males and 21,143 females, were violent deaths.\nIt must also be stated that 498 of these males and 123 of the\nfemales were intoxicated when the accident or other violence\nwhich proved fatal occurred to them. 4,175 of these violent\ndeaths were by railway accidents; 5,898 by accidents in\nor about mines; 28,114 by mechanical in.] urie4, such as\nfractures, falls' or being run over; 14,921 by chymical '\nirjuries, such as burns scalds, poisoning; 23,823 by\nasphyxia or suspension of respiration chiefly by drowning\nor suffocation; 6,896 by violence not particularly de-\nscribed. The whole number is equal to the popula-\ntion of a large city, such as Norwich; 19,510 of these\nviolent deaths, not very far from a fourth of the whole\nnumber, were deaths of children under 5 years of age;\n3,933 children were burnt to death, 3,267 scalded to\ndeath, 1,950 drowned, 5,134 suffocated; so difficult is the\nentrance upon life' 6,696 of the violent deaths were suicides\n\u20141,905 males, 1791 females; 21 boys and 15 girls under 15\nyears old committed suicide, most of the boys by hang-\ning and most of the girls by drowning\u2014one girl who\ndrowned herself was under 5 years of age; 130 lads and\n165 girls between 15 and 20 committed suicide; 252 young\nmen and 163 young women between 20 and 25; 664\nmen and 272 women between 25 and 35 ; 9 l 9 men and 330\nwomen between 35 and 45; 1,135 men and 382 women\nbetween 45 and 55; 1,066 men and 261 women between\n55 and 66; 688 men and 203 women above 65. The\nvariation with age in the ratios of the sexes will be\nobserved: The deaths of 630 males and 633 females in the\nfive years are returned as having occurred from murder and\ninfanticide ; 810 whose age was under one month, 874 under\none year, 921 under four years\u2014again proving the diffi-\nrtzlty of entrance upon life. Among the curiosities upon\nthe death roll by violence for the five years these may be\ninstanced :\u2014Two persons, one very old and one very\nyoung, killed by game cocks; one person from artificial\nteeth ; others from swallowing a fish-bone, swallowing\na plum-stone, or from the sting of a bee; children from\nswallowing a pin, a needle, a halfpenny, a nutshell, a\nbank zone also from the sting of a wasp. _ . _\n\nTo WRITERS.\u2014Never write on a subject without\nhaving first read yourself full on it; never read on a\nsubject till you have thought yourself hungry on it.\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE.\u2014Most men work for the\npresent, a few for the future. The wise work for both\n\u2014for the future in the present, and for the present in\nthe future.\n\nVicious habits are so great a strain to human nature,\nand so odious in themselves, that every person. ac-\ntuated by right reason would avoid them, though he\nwere sure they would be always concealed, both from\nGod and man, and had no future punishment entailed\nupon them.\nIMPROVEMENT IN LOCOMOTIVE ENGINES.\u2014If we\nreview the course of locomotive improvement during\nthe 30 years intervening between 1833 and 1868, we\nshall find that the main features of the machine re-\nmain with little alteration, and that the principal\nchanges have been an augmentation in the size of\nthe engines, and the introduction of certain structural\nameliorations in the details. The traffic on the rail-\nways has, during this time, greatly increased, and not\nonly are there more frequent trains, but there are\nmore passengers and goods presenting themselves to\nbe transported by each train ; so that the weight of\nthe trains has increased as well as their number, and\nthis progression is still going on. Then it has been\nfound to be cheaper to transport a given weight of\nnumbermerchandise\ng ihnt ones fw\nof the locomotive has been gradually growing until\nwe have some goods engines weighing about GO tons.\nThe objection to such very heavy engines is that they\ne s\no heavy\nthat tirhaei ns p thanowe r d a\nweight t\nare very severe upon the permanent way, and it\nwould indeed be greatly preferable to employ two\ndistinct engines, with their fire-boxes brought to\nthe same tender, as recommended by me to be done\nin the first edition of my former \"Treatise on the\nSteam Engine,\" published in the year 1845. If at a\nspeed of 60 miles an hour we take the resistance at\n301 b. per ton, then a train weighing, with engine and\ntender, 200 tons, will require a tractive force of\n6,000 lb. to draw it even on a level; and if the gradi-\nents be at the same time steep, it is easy to see that\nthe locomotive must necessarily be both powerful and\nheavy which has to fulfil the prescribed conditions.\nIn every way difficulties present themselves to the\ngeneration of a very large power in a single engine.\nThe utmost diameter of the barrel of the boiler that\ncan be got between the wheels of a passenger engine\nin a narrow-gauge lines 4 feet 2 inches; and in such\na diameter it is impossible, if the power be large, to\nget the necessary colorimeter or tube area to transmit\nthe smoke without the use of so powerful a blast as\nwill consume a large part of the engine-power by the\nback-pressure it throws upon the piston. There is a\nsimilar difficulty with the heating surface. In some\ncases the barrel of the boiler has been made oval, to\nenable more tubes to be got in; and, in the case of\nsome\ned oouf btht\nebFer\nepnrcohj ecgteodo d\nsb.eeynogin\nnd\nest hi\nte\niswheels, 5\ngoods engines with very small wheels, the barrel may\nand\nfeet n\ndiameter. Oval barrels are objectionable, especially\nin the case of boilers carrying very high pressures.\nThe best expedient for working heavy trains at the\npresent time consists in the use of two six-wheeled\nlocomotives, with a six-wheeled tender placed bet-\nween them.\u2014Bourne' s \"Steam.

On the 11th instant he attacked\nthe rebels at a place called Waisoe, where they were\nstrongly entrenched and somewhat numerous. It\nappears that these were the men who had left different\nstrongholds in rebel possession, with the intention\nof checking Gordon's movements throughout the open\nterritory. The idea was good enough, and the forces\nto whose charge the carrying out of it was en-\ntrusted, were the most desperate men in the Taeping\nranks, being the original rebels from Kiangsu and\nHupee. The Colonel began by shelling the position,\nand the effect of this was that their left flank was\nspeedily turned, upon which they began to retreat.\nGordon then gave orders to change them, which was\ndone, in a very effective manner, by the imperial troops,\nwho seemed to be rather powerful in pursuing an enemy.\nThe reports which have reached us state that the\nTaepings were rather severely cut up, the line of retreat\nbeing literally strewed with the dead.

Inspector Bren-\nnan and Ranger went to the rear of the tea shop, while\nwitness and the inspector went in by the front way of\n142, and there saw Brewerton and his wife and Jeffrey\nand his wife. Inspector Potter then told them that\nthey were police officers and that they must consider\nthemselves in custody for breaking into the house of\nMr. Walker and stealing therefrom a quantity of jew-\nellry. They were told that they had assistance outside.\n6ergeant Mess here described the struggle which took\nplace with the prisoners, as already described, and pro-\nduced the five parcels of gold chains which were taken\nfrom the woman. Ile read over the list of the contents\nof each parcel, enumerating them as gold Alberts,\nchains, necklaces, seals, &c. In one packet f here were\nfifteen chains. The prisoners were removed to the\nstation, and then afterwards went to Casley's house, Ely.\nplace, Bow road, where they forced the door. Inspec-\ntor Potter went in first, witness following. Be saw\nMrs. Casley at the top of the stairs, and Casley went\ninto one of the moms. Tl,ey were then told that they\nwere police officers, and that they would be charged\nwith entering the premises of Mr. Walker and steal-\ning jewellry. They were then handed over to\nInspector Putter, and they went into the room\nwhere they had seen Casley, and found there two\nboxes, a large and a small one. He broke open the\nsmaller one with a pair of tongs. There were several\nwatches partly contained in a newspaper, and in the\npresence of Inspector Potter he corded the box, wh ch\nwas handed over to other officers. On searching down-\nstairs he found a piece of steel, several skeleton keys, a\nhammer, a \"jemmy,\" and other housebreaking imple-\nments, which IN eie loose. They searched the large\nbox, and found there some shawls and some silks. The\nprisoners were taken to Leman street police station,\ntogether with the box. The box was there opened in\nthe presence of Inspector Potter, Inspector Brennan,\nand witness, when it was found to contain about seventy\ngold chains, together with rings, keys, and brooches.\nIn a bag in the box there were four chains and two\nhalf-guinea coins and one guinea, besides chains, rings,\na \u00a35O note, \u00a3196 10s. in gold, also a \u00a35 note and\n\u00a3l9 in gold.

Mind, my wife had nothing\nto do with this, but I mean to plead guilty.\" He said\nhe had nothing to do with Johnson's job, for he was\ndoing Vme then.

(Laughter.)\nCasley then said he could prove a distinct alibi both\nin the case of Walker and Johnson. He had the docu-\nment in his pocket which was from the chaplain of the\nNew Birmingham Gaol, and bearing his signalure,\nshowing that he had spoken to prisoner the day before,\nand after Walker's robbery. He had also another letter\nshowing that he was at work when Johnson's robbery\nwas committed. They were two distinct alibis, but he\nwould not then produce them, as he did not wish the\npolice to get hold of them.\nJoseph George Hicks, a watch plate maker, of\nClerkenwell, deposed to the prisoner David Roberts\nhaving brought him two gold watches to put the name\non the plates, \" Hilton, Wilton square, Loncl.on.\"\nThey were quite plain when brought to him, and when\nfinished he took them to a house in Wilderness row by\nRoberts's direction.\nMr. Walker, jun., identified the property, placing the\nvalue of the rwcovered chains, Sce., at \u00a3750, and the\nwatches at \u00a35OO.\n\nThe whole of the prisoners, with the exception of\nDavid Roberts, the weaver, were then charged with\nthe burglary and robbery at Mr. Johnson's, of Thread-\nneedle street.\n\nInapeetor Brennan said that about the 25th of\nJanuary last he went to Constable Alley, Hoxton, and\nfound the prisoner Scotty, or Brown, in bed He charged\nhim with the burglary. He felt in his trousers pockets\nand found two signet rings and a watch key, and on\nthe mantelpiece a gold watch and chain. The rings,\nwatch, and key were identified by Mr. Johnson. On\nthe next day witness went in company with Inspector\nPotter and 'Police constable Ranger to a chandler's\nshop keeper in Golden lane, when the man\n.gave him a\nreticule, containing a watch, a pair of earrings, sleeve\nlinks, a necklet, coral necklet, two solitaires, a gold\nbar, two rings, and a watch and spring, all of which\nbad been identified by Mr. Johnson. He then went\nto a man named Palmer, at the Pitt's Head, Old street,\nand received from him a banker's book containing an\nentry of \u00a362 2s. paid in and \u00a33B in gold. At 8 o'clock\non the 18th February, in company with Inspector\nPotter and Constable Ranger, witness apprthended\nHurley in the Cambridge road with two other\nmen, on suspicion of a tea robbery in Thames street.\nThey could not be identified. 'Witness then took Hurley\nto the Bow street Police station, where he charged him\nwith being connected with the burglary and robbery at\nMr. Abraham's in the Strand, and also with that of Mr.\nJohnson's, of Threadneedle street. On the 24th of\nFebruary he apprehended Mrs. Jeffrey at 142, White-\nchapel road, and on one of her fingers he saw four rings,\nwhich had been identified by Mr. Johnson.

It contained a bunch of\ncharms and two rings, and the woman had on her finger\na wedding ring. Witness asked who Billy was, when\nCasley said it was Barrett. Witness told him they had\nhim custody. The above property was identified by\nMr. Johnson.\n\nSergeant Moss next deposed to taking a pin from the\nscarf of Brewerton.\n\nMrs. Brewerton said she had pledged that pin six\nmonths before the burglary at Mr. Johnson's.\nPolice constable Ranger then stated that he assisted\nin the apprehension of the prisoners. At Casley's house\nhe found in the bakehouse a dark lantern and a quan-\ntity of housebreaking tools, and a life preserver. Two\nInverness capes were also found, and two crowned hats.\nWitness had compared the \" jemmy\" with the marks on\nthe locks of Mr. Johnson's premises.\nJames Kelly, a carpenter, said in March last he had\nrepaired locks at the premises of Mr. Johnson, and that\nwhile so engaged two of the prisoners came and spoke\nto him.

Witness had known Scotty for some time.\nIle was always respectably dressed. He did not know\n-what he was, nor never inquired. He brought some\nplain gold pins to him.

Lewis, jun., and Mr. F. Beard were present,\nas before, for their respective clients.\nDetective Sergeant Moss, of the City Force, on being\nexamined by Mr. Lewis, said : on Friday, the 24th ot\nFebruary, he accompanied Inspector Potter to the house\nof 13rewerton, 142, Whitechapel road. Inspector Bren-\nnan and Ranger went to the rear of the tea shop, while\nwitness and the inspector went in by the front way of\n142, and there saw Brewerton and his wife and Jeffrey\nand his wife. Inspector Potter then told them that\nthey were police officers and that they must consider\nthemselves in custody for breaking into the house of\nMr. Walker and stealing therefrom a quantity of jew-\nellry. They were told that they had assistance outside.\n6ergeant Mess here described the struggle which took\nplace with the prisoners, as already described, and pro-\nduced the five parcels of gold chains which were taken\nfrom the woman. Ile read over the list of the contents\nof each parcel, enumerating them as gold Alberts,\nchains, necklaces, seals, &c. In one packet f here were\nfifteen chains. The prisoners were removed to the\nstation, and then afterwards went to Casley's house, Ely.\nplace, Bow road, where they forced the door. Inspec-\ntor Potter went in first, witness following. Be saw\nMrs. Casley at the top of the stairs, and Casley went\ninto one of the moms. Tl,ey were then told that they\nwere police officers, and that they would be charged\nwith entering the premises of Mr. Walker and steal-\ning jewellry. They were then handed over to\nInspector Putter, and they went into the room\nwhere they had seen Casley, and found there two\nboxes, a large and a small one. He broke open the\nsmaller one with a pair of tongs. There were several\nwatches partly contained in a newspaper, and in the\npresence of Inspector Potter he corded the box, wh ch\nwas handed over to other officers. On searching down-\nstairs he found a piece of steel, several skeleton keys, a\nhammer, a \"jemmy,\" and other housebreaking imple-\nments, which IN eie loose. They searched the large\nbox, and found there some shawls and some silks. The\nprisoners were taken to Leman street police station,\ntogether with the box. The box was there opened in\nthe presence of Inspector Potter, Inspector Brennan,\nand witness, when it was found to contain about seventy\ngold chains, together with rings, keys, and brooches.\nIn a bag in the box there were four chains and two\nhalf-guinea coins and one guinea, besides chains, rings,\na \u00a35O note, \u00a3196 10s. in gold, also a \u00a35 note and\n\u00a3l9 in gold. There were besides 52 gold watches and\none silver one.\n\nBy Mr. Lewis: As witness was in the cab with the\nbox Casley said, pointing to the box, \"You've got all\nWalker's property there. Mind, my wife had nothing\nto do with this, but I mean to plead guilty.\" He said\nhe had nothing to do with Johnson's job, for he was\ndoing Vme then. Some chains which were found in his\npossession he accounted for by saying that he picked\nthem up on Jeffrey's stairs.\nSergeant Moss then produced a quantity of rope and\na beard, which were found at Jeffrey's\u2014the former.\nbeing used to make rope-ladders, and the latter for a\ndisguise.\nC:aaley again wishing to speak for the purpose of\nasking the witness what his (prisoner's) father had said\nto him.\n\nSergeant Moss replied that he told him that he (pri-\nsoner) was called \" Counseller Terry\" at a judge and\njury club. (Laughter.)\nCasley then said he could prove a distinct alibi both\nin the case of Walker and Johnson. He had the docu-\nment in his pocket which was from the chaplain of the\nNew Birmingham Gaol, and bearing his signalure,\nshowing that he had spoken to prisoner the day before,\nand after Walker's robbery. He had also another letter\nshowing that he was at work when Johnson's robbery\nwas committed. They were two distinct alibis, but he\nwould not then produce them, as he did not wish the\npolice to get hold of them.\nJoseph George Hicks, a watch plate maker, of\nClerkenwell, deposed to the prisoner David Roberts\nhaving brought him two gold watches to put the name\non the plates, \" Hilton, Wilton square, Loncl.on.\"\nThey were quite plain when brought to him, and when\nfinished he took them to a house in Wilderness row by\nRoberts's direction.\nMr. Walker, jun., identified the property, placing the\nvalue of the rwcovered chains, Sce., at \u00a3750, and the\nwatches at \u00a35OO.\n\nThe whole of the prisoners, with the exception of\nDavid Roberts, the weaver, were then charged with\nthe burglary and robbery at Mr. Johnson's, of Thread-\nneedle street.\n\nInapeetor Brennan said that about the 25th of\nJanuary last he went to Constable Alley, Hoxton, and\nfound the prisoner Scotty, or Brown, in bed He charged\nhim with the burglary. He felt in his trousers pockets\nand found two signet rings and a watch key, and on\nthe mantelpiece a gold watch and chain. The rings,\nwatch, and key were identified by Mr. Johnson. On\nthe next day witness went in company with Inspector\nPotter and 'Police constable Ranger to a chandler's\nshop keeper in Golden lane, when the man\n.gave him a\nreticule, containing a watch, a pair of earrings, sleeve\nlinks, a necklet, coral necklet, two solitaires, a gold\nbar, two rings, and a watch and spring, all of which\nbad been identified by Mr. Johnson. He then went\nto a man named Palmer, at the Pitt's Head, Old street,\nand received from him a banker's book containing an\nentry of \u00a362 2s. paid in and \u00a33B in gold. At 8 o'clock\non the 18th February, in company with Inspector\nPotter and Constable Ranger, witness apprthended\nHurley in the Cambridge road with two other\nmen, on suspicion of a tea robbery in Thames street.\nThey could not be identified. 'Witness then took Hurley\nto the Bow street Police station, where he charged him\nwith being connected with the burglary and robbery at\nMr. Abraham's in the Strand, and also with that of Mr.\nJohnson's, of Threadneedle street. On the 24th of\nFebruary he apprehended Mrs. Jeffrey at 142, White-\nchapel road, and on one of her fingers he saw four rings,\nwhich had been identified by Mr. Johnson. The same\nday he went to Casley's house, and he told him he was\ngoing to apprehend him for several jewel robberier4.\nHe then said to his wife, \"Give me those things that\n'Billy gave me.\" She gave a portmonnaie to him,\nwhich she gave to witneis. It contained a bunch of\ncharms and two rings, and the woman had on her finger\na wedding ring. Witness asked who Billy was, when\nCasley said it was Barrett. Witness told him they had\nhim custody. The above property was identified by\nMr. Johnson.\n\nSergeant Moss next deposed to taking a pin from the\nscarf of Brewerton.\n\nMrs. Brewerton said she had pledged that pin six\nmonths before the burglary at Mr. Johnson's.\nPolice constable Ranger then stated that he assisted\nin the apprehension of the prisoners. At Casley's house\nhe found in the bakehouse a dark lantern and a quan-\ntity of housebreaking tools, and a life preserver. Two\nInverness capes were also found, and two crowned hats.\nWitness had compared the \" jemmy\" with the marks on\nthe locks of Mr. Johnson's premises.\nJames Kelly, a carpenter, said in March last he had\nrepaired locks at the premises of Mr. Johnson, and that\nwhile so engaged two of the prisoners came and spoke\nto him. Ile pointed out Casley and Brewerton as the\nmen, but with much hesitation.\n\nJames Wr e, a compenaation balance maker, said he\nknew \" Scotty\" formerly, while witness kept a beer\nhouse. He had bought two pairs of earrings from him,\nthe cost price of wirch would be six or seven guineas.\nHe also left with him a pearl cross to repair\u2014to put a\nstone in it. Witness had known Scotty for some time.\nIle was always respectably dressed. He did not know\n-what he was, nor never inquired. He brought some\nplain gold pins to him. Witness never asked him\nanything about as to how he got them.\nWilliam Bower, of the Lord Wellington, University\nstreet, Tottenham Court Road: He was related by\nmarriage to las. witne-s, who one day in July last came\nto him and offered him a pair of earrings for sale, for\nwhich he gave 50s. They had been in wear about six\nmouths. Hut bt ought th,ern this morning and showed\nthem to Mr. Johnson.\n\nMr. Johnson had some like them, but he could not\nswear to hose produced.\n\nStephen Brown, a fishmonger, recognised Scotty as\nhaving (flee offered him some jewellery for sale. That\nwas the later end of July. He offered him a brooch.\nHe took two or three articles from his pocket. The\nbrooch, he thought, was a mourning brooch, with\ndiamonds. Witness one eveninglook charge of from\n\u00a32O to-\u00a34O for him, which be fetched away. He after-\nwards bought apar of earrings from him for ss. He\nhad given them up to In.pector Potter. He never in-\nquired how Scotty gut the jewellery. He thought be\nwas a traveller.\n\nMrs. Charlotte P-ar said she purchased three duPli-\ncat es from the female prisoner Hurl.y, two for bratches\nand one for a pair of earrings. They were ple iged\nin the Borough road and in the Whitechapel road.\nShe redeemed thsm, the money amounting to 1:,2 78.\nShe had since given them to Inspector Potter. Witness\nbelieved she had seen Mrs. Hurley wearing the earrings.\n\nMr. Johnson hero vi,wed the property and identified\nsome which had connection with Brewerton\u2014also with\nBlown. One of the numbers of the watches had been\nmost cleverly altered from 2,155 to 12,466. The pro\nperry, which had been sold but recovered, was disposed\nof for a considerably less value than cost price.\nBy Mr. Lewis: The amount recovered would be\nabout \u00a34O or \u00a35O. His loss was \u00a34,000.\n\nThe prisoners were then remanded for a week, and\nthe Lord Mayor declined to entertain an application by\nMr. Beard to admit the female prison Jeffrey and\nCmley to bail.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS,\n\nSTROMBOLI\u2014Letters from Sicily announce that the\nisland of Stromboli, in its turn, threatens an eruption,\nas already columnes of smoke, furrowed with streaks of\nlight, arise above it.\nTHE FIRST ACT OF THE SESSIONS.\u2014On March 7,\nwas issued the first Act passed during the present\nsession, the object of which was to correct an Act\npassed last year to amend the Civil Bill C.,urts Pro-\ncedure Act.

The evidence was to the\neffect that the defendant had been seen trespassing in\npursuit of game after eleven o'clock on the night of\nthe 11th. January. The case was first called upon some\nten days ago, and then Mr. Learoyd applied for an ad-\njournment, because a man who would prove that Shaw\nwas not out of the house that night was too ill to attend,\nand he also asked that the magistrate would see the man\nand take his deposition. It was agreed that the Rev.\nC. A. Hulbert, incumbent of Slaithwaite, should see-\nthe witness and take down his statement. This was\ndone, and it was said it entirely cleared the defendant\nfrom the charge. Since then the witness had died.\nWhen the case came on for heating, Mr. Freeman\noffered to withdraw the charge on payment of expenses\nit Shaw would acknowledge himself guilty, but this\noffer was refused. The case then proceeded; the Bench\ndeclined to accept the statement as evidence, and fined\nthe defendant ss. and costs.\n\nRELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN BAVARIA.\u2014The Court of\nAppeal of Deux Ponta (Bavarian Palatinate) has just\ndecided a case of considerable interest to German Pro-\ntestants.

The father, being a Protestant, of course\ndecided upon aducating the children in his own religion,\nto which the Catholic co-guardian, at the instigation of\nthe Catholic clergy, objected, bringing the case before\nthe tribunals. The above Court of Appeal has decided\nagainst the complainant, laying down toe principle that\ntribunals are not competent to take cognizance of any\ndispute relating to the religious education of children,\neven in the case of the existence. of written agreements\nbetween the pat-lies. This deoiston has excited great\ninterest throaghout Germany.\nTuv.

Robert Geo. Milne,\nan Independent minister, formerly in charge of a con-\ngregation at Tintwistle, but now residing at South-\nport, sued the London and North-Western Railway\nCompany for damages in consequence of a railway\naccident. The case was a very peauliar one. The\naccident took place at Copley Hill, Leeds, so far back\nas Oct. 16, 1867, but it was not till November, 1863,\nthat plaintiff was permanently disabled. In the\nmeantime he had been engaged as local secretary of\nthe British and Foreign Bible Society at a salary of\n\u00a33OO per year, and travelled, about the country, de-\nlivering addresses on its behalf. On November 12,\n1863, thirteen months after the accident, he had a\nparalytic attack which rendered him so complete a\nwreck that his evidence had to be taken by commis-\nsion. The question in dispute was -whether the\nparalysis resulted from the accident. The defendants\ncontended that it was too remote from the time of the\ncollision to have been caused by it, and the fact that\nthe plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel\nabout the country and deliver addresses, night after\nnight, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible\nSociety, was relied on in proof of this. On the other\nside it was maintained that from the time of the acci-\ndent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the\nfinal seizure, and that there was a continuity of\nsymptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were\ncalled on each side who directly contradicted each\nother as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The\njudge, in summing up, said the plaintiff. was clearly\nentitled to damages for the sufferings he had under-\ngone since the time of the accident, but he could give\nno assistance as to the real point at issue. After a\nconsultation of twenty minutes, the jury returned a\nverdict for the plaintiff\u2014Damages \u00a32,000.\n","355916":"rtfE B lIIVI, SATUIWAII APRIL 299 1848.\n\nthe subscription list forwarded on this Week hy\nBaker, from Tunstall. -Mr. Carlisle, deputed by the\ntrierley hill executive, is now in London, suktrlnfend4\ning the arrangements for the emigration ta New\nZealand of fifty of the North Staffordshire men with\ntheir families, who leave the London docks on the 10th\nof May in the ship Andrew Jackson, expressly charterea I\nfor them by Messrs.

The brave fellows\nare as determined now as in the first week of the\nstruggle. There are 912 men now on strike tobe supported,\nand although some substantial assistance will now be\nrendered them from the South district, it must be\nrecollected they have been receiving only 2s. 6d. per\nweek for some weeks past, and therefore it is highly\nnecessary that the relief sent them flora the South\nshould be still supplemented by subscriptions from\ntrades in other districts.

The deputation of men went away to con-\nsult their club, and another conference between masters\nand: men was held. All differences were then removed.\nA code of rules was agreed to very similar to those\nadopted by the bricklayers, and 60 the strike, which has\nlasted aeven weeks, has been brought than end, and the\nmen returned to their work.

No-\nthing can be more precise and formal than the decree\nby NA hich the Queen of Spain professes to put an effec-\ntual stop to the slave trade in her dominions; and con-\nsidering that her Government has these many years\nsince been pledged to the adoption of that measure, and\nthat in. retutn for that pledge it has accepted a heavy\nsum in hard cash, there is, perhaps,. some small degree\nof merit in this t,,rdy and reluctant fulfilment of a\nsolemn obligation. It coincides, however' in a strange\nand suspicious manner with the sudden desire of the\nCubans for the emancipation of their slaves;, and\nthat desire in its turn falls in wonderfully with the\nextinction of slavery in the late Confederate States.\nThe planters of Cuba may, for all we know, be act-\ning from the purest of motives, but the time of\naction is ill-chosen for their reputation of unalloyed\nbenevolence. Slavery\u2014in Yankee verbiage\u2014is pretty\nwell \"played out \" in the United States, and it needs\nno very intimate acquaintance with the American\ncharacter to anticipate some of the immediate conse-\nquences of that momentous change. American states-\nmen are not likely to subject their young free-laboar\nsystem to the crucial test of a competition with Cuban\nslave labour.

She endeavoured\nto prevent him, and he then struck he in the face and\nthree times on the neck. She gave him into custody,\nand on the wtey to the station Brown attempted to push\nhim away from the constable.\nThe prisoner Richardson said he was passing the\nhouse in question, which is situated next door to the\nentrance to a chapel, when he saw two women\nhalf naked sitting at the parlour window, and they\nbeckoned him to go up. He did so, and after some\nconversation a disturbance took place, but he did not\nstrike any woman.\nThe other prisoner said he was drunk, and did not\nknow what he was about. _\n\n_\nMr. Barker asked the witness if the defence was\ntrue, and what sort of a house it was?\nWitness: It is a quiet house, and my master and\nmistress are milliners, but I never see any work done\nor anything wrong, I can assure you. There was only\none \"young lady\" in the house, and she had on a low\ndress, and that was, perhaps, what the prisdner meant\nby saying the females were half-naked. There was\nnever anything wrong done at the house she would\nmost solemnly assure the magistrate.\nMr. Alexander (second clerk)\u2014But you have several\nyoung women lodging there, have you not?\u2014come,\ntell the truth about it.\nWitness: There are some \"young ladies\" lodging\nthere who are visited by their friends, but I never saw\nanything wrong.\nMr. Alexander: And the \" friends \" you speak of\nare generally men?\nWitness: Oh, yes, they are \" gentlemen ; lowpeople\ndo not come to our house.\n_\n\nA stylishly-dressed woman got into the box, said\nher name was Edwards, and that she resided in the\nhouse in question.

On Monday last she went to Woolwich\nand returned with a soldier. On Tuesday she got up and\nwent out and returned with a large quantity of sugar\nof lead, which she mixed with some hot water and\ndrank. The women gave an alarm, and a surgeon was\nsent for, who having administered an emetic advised\nher removal to the hospital. There the stomach pump.\nwas used, and a large quantity of sugar of lead re-\nmoved from her. She had heard the prisoner since\nthen say that she was tired of her life, and that she\nwas determined to destroy herself, as she had no one\nto live or care for.\n\nPolice-serjeant Parry, 47 S, said that he took the\ndefendant into custody, and even after she had taken\nan emetic and been attended to at the hospital she\nbrought up more poison whilst at the police-station.\nThe defendant then appeared in a low, desponding\nstate, and seemed deeply to regret the act she was\nfooliEh enough to attempt to commit. She also said.\nthat her husband, when she married him, was an\narchitect and marble carver, that she left him, and\nthat he then sold his business, and is now an officer\neither in the Sappers and Miners or the Royal\nArtillery. Her friends are highly respectable, and\nmentioning the name of her brother, said that he\nis now mayor of a country town and iii a large way\nof business. He believed from what he had heard\nthat her statement was true. The defendant, although\nshe had eloped from her husband, and was leading\na disreputable life, mixing as she did with some of\nthe lowest prostitutes in Somers' Town, and residing\nat a notorious brothel, was generally well conducted,\nand \u2022 very quiet person. When she was takerf in cus-\ntody she said she was very unhappy, and at the hos-\npital it was stated that she had taken poison enough\nto kill a horse.\n\nThe defendant, who seemed very downcast, said that\nshe did not care what was done to her, or what be-\ncame of her.\n\nMr. Barker said it would not be safe for her go at\nlarge at present, and therefore he should remand her\nto the House of Detention until Weinesday next. She\nwould then see the chaplain, and he trusted that she\nwould pay attention to his advice, and se the folly of\nher wicked act. By Wednesday next he hoped her\nfriends would hear where she was, and come forward\nand take her away from her present bad associates.\nThe defendant, who began to cry, was then re-\nmoved.\n\nTHE BRIGHTON RAILWAY ACCIDENT.\u2014On Wednes-\nday, Mr. W.

He stated that he\nconsidered tank engines the safest and best kind of\nengine that could be used for traffic on this particular\nline, namely, between Victoria, London-bridge, and\nCroydon. He had heard nothing to account for the\naccident, except the irregular shutting off of the steam.\nColonel Yolland, who had made an inquiry by direc-\ntion of the Board of Trade, said that the permanent\nway was not strong enough to bear the weight of the\nengine and carriages running at such a speed. He\ndid not think it expedient to run at the rate of sixty\nmiles an hour with tank engines having eighteen feet\nsix inches wheel basis, especially when the engine was\nnot tightly screwed up to the break van behind it.\nThe jury, after deliberating for an hour, returned the\nfollowing verdict :\u2014\" That the deceased persons seve-\nrally came by their deaths from accident, and we, the\njury, are of opinion that it was attributable to the\nhigh rate of speed at which the express trains run over\nthe line from Croydon to Victoria.

While in the act of stepping from one\npart of a lofty stage to another the platform suddenly\noverset, and deceased was thrown headlong to the\nbottom of the dock, a distance of nearly forty feet.\nHe came upon his head, and was killed instanta-\nneously, his remains being shockingly mangled. The\naccident arose, it was said, entirely through the fault\nof deceased in stepping upon a wrong portion of the\nstage. A verdict of accidental death was returned.\n\nCOLLISION AND Loss OF LIFE ON THE THAMES.\nMr. Humphreys held an inquiry at the Albion Tavern,\nHigh-street, Shadwell, into the circumstances of a\ncollision between an outward-bound ship and a Trinity\nHouse ballast lighter, by which Benjamin Livermore,\ncaptain of the latter, lost his life.

There are 912 men now on strike tobe supported,\nand although some substantial assistance will now be\nrendered them from the South district, it must be\nrecollected they have been receiving only 2s. 6d. per\nweek for some weeks past, and therefore it is highly\nnecessary that the relief sent them flora the South\nshould be still supplemented by subscriptions from\ntrades in other districts.

The only questions in dispute left were some\nrules in the proposed code as to non-interference and\npiece work. The deputation of men went away to con-\nsult their club, and another conference between masters\nand: men was held. All differences were then removed.\nA code of rules was agreed to very similar to those\nadopted by the bricklayers, and 60 the strike, which has\nlasted aeven weeks, has been brought than end, and the\nmen returned to their work.

If the precepts of faith elevate our soul above\nthe interests of this world, the lessons of history in their\nturn inspire as with the love of .what is beautiful and\njust, the hatred of that which opposes an obstacle to\nthe progress of humanity. To be profitable, these\nle-sons require certain conditions. It is necessary\nthat the facts should be reproduced with rigorous ex-\naAitude ; th9t political or social changes should be\nphilosophically analysed; that the piquant attraction\nof details in the life of public men should not turn away\nattention from the part they have played in politics,\nand ehould not cause their providential mission to be\nforgotten.\n\"Too frequently the writer presents to us the\ndifferent phases of history as spontaneous events, with-\nout searching for their true origin and their natural\ndeduction in previous facts; similarly to the painter\nwho, in reproducing the accidents of nature, only looks\nto their pleturesque effect, without being able to give\ntheir scientific demonstration in his picture. The\nhistorian must be more than a painter; like the geo-\nlogist, who explains the phenomena of the globe, he\nought to disclose the secret of the transformation of\n\n\"But what is the method of arriving at truth in\nwritinc, history? It is to follow the rules of logic.\nLet us first take for certain that a great effect is always\ndue to a great cause; never to a small one; in other\nwords, an accident, apparently insignificant, never pro-\nduces important retilts without a pre-existing cause,\nwhich has permitted this slight accident to bring about\na great effect. The spark only kindles a vast confla-\ngration when it falls upon combustible materials\npreviously collected. Montesquieu thus confirms this\nidea: It is not fortune,' he says, 'which rules the\nworld. . . . There are general causes, either moral\nor physical, which operate in every monarchy, raise it,\nmaintain it, or overthrow it; all accidents are subject\nto these chases, and if the chance of a battle, that is to\nsay, a particular cause, has ruined the State, there was\na general cause which operated so that the State must\np-rish by a single battle; in a word, the principal cause\ndraws after it all the particular accidents.'*\n\"If during nearly 1,000 years, the Romans always\nissued triumphantly from the hardest trials and the\ngreatest perils, it was because a general cause existed\nwhich made them always superior to their enemies, and\ndid not permit defeats and partial misfortunes to entail\nthe fall of their empire. It the Romans, after having\ngiven to the world the spectacle of a people constitu-\nting itself and growing great by liberty, have seemed\nsince Cmsar's day to fall blindly -into slavery, it is\nbecause there existed a general reason .which fatally\nprevented the republic from returning to the purity of\nits ancient institutions; it is because the new necessities\nand interests of a nation in travail required other\nmeans of being satisfied. As logic shows us in im-\nportant events the imperative necessity of their exist-\nence, so we must recognise both in the long duration of\nan institution the proof of its excellence, and in the\nincontestable influence of a man upon his age the proof\nof his genius.\n\"The problem, then, is to determine ti.ihotifte..sli\n,3-\nment which constitut4lt\" he strength ^\" -\nthe predominating le\n'\nI we institution,\nn. ftoalorwilFunst: which the man acted.\nl rule, we shall avoid the errars of those\naistorians who gather facts transmitted by preceding\nages, without co-ordinating them according to their\nphilosophical importance, thus glorifying that which\nmerits blame and leaving in shadow that which requires\nlight. It is not a minute analysis of the Roman\norganisation which will enable us to comprehend the\nduration of so great an empire, but the profound\nexamination of the spirit of its institutions; nor is it a\ndetailed recital of the slightest actions of a distinguished\nman which will reveal to us the secret of his ascendancy,\nbut an attentive search into the elevated motives of his\nconduct.\n\n\"When extraordinary facts bear witness to eminent\ngenius, what can be more contrary to good sense than to\nattribute to it all the passions and all the sentiments of\nmediocrity? What can be more erroneous than not to\nrecognise the pre-eminence of those privileged beings\nwho appear from time to time in history like luminous\nbeacons, dissipating the darkness of their age, and\nlighting up the future? To deny this pre-eminence\nwould indeed be to insult humanity, in believing it\ncapable of submitting, for .a long time and voluntarily,\nto a dominion which did not rest upon veritable great-\nness and incontestable utility. \u2022 Let us be logical, and\nwe shall be just.\n\"Too. many historians find it easier to deny men of\ngenius than, with a generous inspiration to raise them-\nselves to their height by penetrating their vast designs.\nThus in Cmsar's case, instead of showing us Rome torn\nby civil wars, corrupted by riches, treading her ancient\ninstitutions under foot, threatened by powerful peoples\n\u2014the Gauls, the Germans and the Parthians\u2014incapable\nof sustaining herself without a stronger, more stable,\nand juster central power: instead, I say, of tracing this\nfaithful picture, Cmsar is represented to us as already\ndreaming of the supreme power from early youth. if\nhe resists Scylla, if he disagrees with Cicero, if he allies\nhimself with Pompey, it is owing to that far sighted\nastuteness which has divined all to enslave all; if he\nmakes a foray into Gaul, it (is to acquire riches by\npillage,t or soldiers devoted to his schemes; if he\ncrosses the sea to carry the Roman eagles into an un-\nknown country, but the conquest of which will confirm\nthat of Gaul,:t. it is to seek the pearls which were\nbelieved to exist in the waters of Great Britain \u00a7 ; if,\nafter having vanquished the redoubtable enemies of Italy\nbeyond the Alps, he meditates an expedition against\nthe Parthians to avenge the defeat of Crassus, it is, say\nceitain historians, because an active life suited his nature,\nand his health was better when upon. a campaign ;11 if\nhe gratefully accepts from the senate a laurel crown, and\nwears it with pride, it is to hide his bald head; if, lastly,\nbe was assassinated by those whom he had overwhelmed\nwith benefits, it is because he meant to make himself\nking\u2014as if he was not thus greater than any king, to\nLie contemporaries as well as to posterity. Since Sue-\ntonius and Plutarch such have been the paltry interpre-\ntations men have found pleasure in giving to the noblest\nactions. But by what mark can we recognise a man's\ngreatness? By the empire of his ideas, when his prin-\nciples and his system triumph in spite of his death or\nhis defeat. Is it not, in fact, the peculiarity of genius\nto survive annihilation, and to extend its empire over\nfuture generations? Cmsar disappears, and his influence\npredominates more even than during his life. Cicero,\nhis adversary, is forced to exclaim, All the actions of\nCmsar, his writings, his words, his promises, his thoughts\nhave greater power after his death than if he still lived.'ll\nFor ages it has been sufficient to tell the world that\nsuch had been the will of User to obtain the world's\nobedience.\n\"The above shows sufficiently the subject I propose\nto myself in writing this history. That object is to\nprove that when Providence raises up such men as\nCmsar, Charlemagne, and Napoleon, it is to trace out\n, for peoples the course they ought to pursue, to set the\nseal of their genius upon a new era, and to accomplish\nthe labour of several ages in a few years. Happy the\nnations who understand and follow them. Wretched\nthey who misconceive and strive against them. They\nact like the Jews\u2014they crucify their Messiah; they are\nblind and guilty\u2014blind, in not perceiving the impor \u2022\ntance of their efforts to arrest the definitive triumph\nof good; guilty, inasmuch as they only retard progress\nby shackling her prompt and fruitful application.\n\"In effect, neither the murder of Cmsar nor the cap-\ntivity of St. Helena have been able irretrievably to\ndestroy two popular causes overthrown by a league dis-\nguising itself under the mask of liberty. In killing\nCmsar' Brutus plunged Rome into the horrors of civil\nwar \u2022 he did not prevent the reign of Augustus, but he\niendered those of Nero and Caligula possible. Neither\nhas the ostracism of Napoleon by associated Europe\nprevented the Empire from reviving; yet, neverthelese,\nhow far are we from the great questions resolved, the\npassions appeased, the legitimate satisfaction given to\npeoples by the First Empire.\n\"Thus is daily verified, since 1815, the prophecy of\nthe captive of St. Helena :\n\" How many conflicts, how much blood, how many\nyears are still requisite before the good I desired to do\nhumanity can be realised!' ** \"NAPOLEON.\n\"Palace of the Tuileries, March 20, 1862.\"\n\n* Montesquieu, \"Grandeur et Decadence des Romainv,\nxviii.\nt Suetonitts, \"Caesar,\" xxii.\n\" Ccesar determined to pass into Britain, the people of which\nhad assisted the Gauls in almost all the ware.\"\u2014Csar \"De\nBello Galileo,\" IV., xx.\n\u00a7 Suetonius, \" Caesar,\"\nn Appian, \"Civil Wars,\" 1., ex., 326, Schweighauser edit.\n'V Cicero, \" Epis. ad Atticum,\" XIV., X.\n*4 In truth, how many agitations, civil wars, and revolution*\nhave not taken place in Europe since 1815\u2014in France, Spain,\nItaly, Poland, Belgium, Hungary, Greece, and Germany.\n\nCARDINAL WISRMAN.\u2014It is stated that Cardinal\nWiseman has left a memoir on the condition of the\nRoman Catholic Church in England, and on his influence\nin developing the interests of his religion in this country.\nAt the end of the memoir are statistical tables, which\nare intended to show that Roman Catholicism has !made\ncontinual progress in England since the cardinal's\narrival, and that by his direct or indirect influence\n71 churches and 35 Roman Catholic convents have been\nbuilt in London and its environs only.

The ships forming the squadron were the Liverpool ( with the flag of Rear-Admiral Hornby), Endymion, Liffey, and Scylla, the Bristol and Barrosa having been left behind, the latter in consequence of the accident. Our correspondent informs us that it was a matter of surprise that the accident to the Barrosa did not end more seriously. Vice-Admiral Sir Sydney Col- poys Dacres, who has been at Devonport during the past few days seeing to the preparations for the depar- ture of the Flying Squadron, will probably return to the Admiralty at Whitehall at once. A rumour is preva- lent at Devonport that the Scylla will not return to England with the squadron, but remain either on the China or Pacific station; and in the event of the Barrosa following the squadron she will be detached for service on one of the distant foreign stations. THE ACCIDENT ON THE GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY. \u2014The inquest on the body of Day, the fireman, who was killed, has been adjourned until Thursday, July 1. The accident has been reported to the Board of Trade, who will send down an inspector. Pending the official inquiry nothing will be done to repair the engine which ran off the rails, and which was one of the tank type. Day was a married man, but leaves no family. Miller, the driver, who was also severely wounded, remained up to Saturday in a doubtful state, and on Friday his sister proceeded from Norwich to Maldon for the purpose of seeing him. It was most providen- tial that the engine did not run about 20 yards farther before it ran off the line, as otherwise the carriages would probably have fallen into a deep water course, and many of the passengers must have been drowned. Besides the fracture of two ribs in the case of Mr. Rune% Mr. F. Parkinson, another passenger, sustained extensive injuries to one of his knee joints and legs. Mr. Pertwee, of Latchingdon, had one arm lacerated, and a working man named Last had his collar bone broken. ","815234":"The fact is, in the South Yorkshire district, the inspector is a known sympathiser with the interests of capital. To him labour is but a thing with which the less law interferes to protect the better. True to his politico- economic creed, he gets as much salary and does as little for it as he can. He never visits a pit when he dares to stop away. He never makes a tour of inspection to see the law is observed to prevent accidents; and, when sent for by the men's fears, either notice is sent of his coming, or some hint is given about the complaint, so that when a flying visit is made there is nothing to see, and the men get a rebuke, or a discharge. Thus, the men object to report or complain of danger. 'There are scores of pits in Yorkshire that the -inspector has never once been into; and hundreds of men who neither know his face nor his address. The inspector is bound to attend all inquests of death from accident's in pits held in this dis- trict; he does not always do even that, or he comes to view long after all traces of accident, or rather of the causes, are carefully removed. And the result is, whereas in the Factories' In- ' spection Act, detection of breach of law before accidents, and of punishment accordingly, are ' frequent, under the Mines' Inspection Act breaches of law before accidents are never heard of, and but very rarely convictions or punishment, when accidents have occurred,. that is, so far as employers are concerned. But woe be to the poor miner who is either caught slipping, or if even the idea of a slip can be detected. The- inspector then is truly a terror, and his wrath is something awful. He carefully avticls having anything to do with the men, and if a aeputation venture to seek an interview, he appoints his own house, per- haps miles away, and therefore, practically, a bar to workmen going. And if even that be got over, all that cold shoulder officialism, and the most offensive red.tapeism, can show is shown. Formali*l4.,riect, ' and 'even _icule and nairgiffhe eWrience of parties who have once sought his presence by appoint- ment; and we leave the reader to judge whether an independent soul'd working man is likely twice to submit to such treatment. We assure our readers that this, and worse; is the rule of the conduct of Charles Merton, of St. John's, Wakefield, Esquire, who, as a public officer, is we submit, fairly open to criticism, as to his public duty. And it is chien this way, to the complete failure- of the Working of the Inspectors' Act\u2014and herein,lies ~the that we attribute the fearful loss of li that South ' Viire is subject to. The chief ' risk, that of life, is run by I men; and it was to protect the men that tlke act, in. defiance of the opposition of the ployers, was passed. But by the connivance of the Derby ministry, then in. power, and by the efforts of J. C. Charlesworth, the chairman of the coal owners' associatAn, then M.P. for Wakefield, it was referred to them to appoint the inspectors. Of course they chose their instill-Incas accordingly, and in this case the employers have been most. fortunate in their selection. In Yorkshire, the act is worked to serve the employer; and the men suffer accor- dingly. Had the men their say in the appoint- ment, (and we would ask if this is not as fair an interpretation of the object of the act, as that the employers should rule the inspectors?) we submit we should bear less of \" Barns- ley Tragedies.\" Then the employers would have tobe a little nifire attentive, and perhaps a little more costly in their appliances, but it would be true policy to enforce upon them. The cost of these explosions is ruinous even to the employers. And what is the 'reason the working men have not their legitimate say, in the measures vital to their own safety? The workilig men are not, represented in the Com- morm-House of Parliament--and the masters are. Working men ponder over that fact, 'and see the censequences, even in the working of the miner's act.. How long will labour endure ' its burthens? when will it rise and assert its own rights and dignity? and put capital and inspectors in their true place, viz., as means to serve .humanity, and not to oppress and abuse? The poor miner might then have length of days, instead of the shortest life, and comfort and independence, instead of pity and contempt. But never as things are. A report of the coroner's inquest held on the Worsbro Dale tragedy has been published, and we especially direct the attention of our readers to the facts elicited. It will be seen clearly that the fault of this misfortune is not with the men. Blasting in a dangerous place is the certain cause of the explosion. Now who caused the men to blast? So far as they were concerned, the men proposed to wedge the coal; but then such is the nature of the prices paid, that they could not live by wedg.\u2022 mg. Then the pressure of the masters, and the stimulus of extra pay, caused the men to ","403071":"The annual return from the Board of Trade concern- ing the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued. It exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase for 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be in mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several items of income and expenditure. The statistics are gigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to illustrate with important truthfulness the immense results which are identified with the railway system of this country, and how these results spring from the necessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485 passengers travelled on the railways in England and Wales, which, taking the population at something under 22,000,000 would give an aver- age of say eight journeys for each individual. From these returns we cull the following statistics of the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of December, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way open, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying 173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those who held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991. In connection with the passengers, there were carried at the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and 327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following great reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of coal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of general merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833 cattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also carried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081 miles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains was 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the passenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods traffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all sources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822. It is an important point to consider how this wonder- ful system of traffic has been performed in respect of the s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the recurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the actual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to estimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met with accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger trains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were killed and 371 injured. The total number of passen- gers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to trains during 1863 on all railways in England and Wales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129 people kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on railways, including trespassers and people killed or injured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa- tion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the general statistics, which may be divided into a more particular form. On the London and North-Western 19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season- ticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen- gers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as compensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts from pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods traffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi- ture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts \u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221 passengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets. There were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his own m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be- yond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as compensation for personal injuries. The receipts were: From passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196. The proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per cent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were 11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four accidents took place, by which 7 passengers were killed and 33 received injuries, which cost the company \u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re- ceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods; the working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net income \u00a3719,903.

The question in dispute - was whether the paralysis resulted from the accident. The defendants contended that it was too remote from the time of the collision to have been caused by it, and the fact that the plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel about the country and deliver addresses, night after night, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible Bociety, was relied on in proof of this.

The ordinary coupling consists of draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws' so as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train close together. There are also safety chains, one on each side of the main coupling. The improvement comes into action the moment the engine or tender happens to diverge at a certain angle from the line of railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of gear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are driven back by the springs into the void left by the draw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are instantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame of the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com- pletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears that accidents from engines running off the rails amount to more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci- dents to railway trains.

To him labour is but a thing with which the less law interferes to protect the better. True to his politico- economic creed, he gets as much salary and does as little for it as he can. He never visits a pit when he dares to stop away. He never makes a tour of inspection to see the law is observed to prevent accidents; and, when sent for by the men's fears, either notice is sent of his coming, or some hint is given about the complaint, so that when a flying visit is made there is nothing to see, and the men get a rebuke, or a discharge. Thus, the men object to report or complain of danger. 'There are scores of pits in Yorkshire that the -inspector has never once been into; and hundreds of men who neither know his face nor his address. The inspector is bound to attend all inquests of death from accident's in pits held in this dis- trict; he does not always do even that, or he comes to view long after all traces of accident, or rather of the causes, are carefully removed. And the result is, whereas in the Factories' In- ' spection Act, detection of breach of law before accidents, and of punishment accordingly, are ' frequent, under the Mines' Inspection Act breaches of law before accidents are never heard of, and but very rarely convictions or punishment, when accidents have occurred,. that is, so far as employers are concerned. But woe be to the poor miner who is either caught slipping, or if even the idea of a slip can be detected. The- inspector then is truly a terror, and his wrath is something awful. He carefully avticls having anything to do with the men, and if a aeputation venture to seek an interview, he appoints his own house, per- haps miles away, and therefore, practically, a bar to workmen going.

SERIOUS ACCIDENT AT TH E RAILWAY BRIDGE, LE D GATE -HILL.\u2014A serious accident occurred on the morning of August 2, about half-past five o'clock, by whit h three men have sustain:A severe injuries, at the railway bridge now in -course of constraction on Ludgate hill, London. Four of the immewe girders had been raised to their inte:.,ded position, and the operations for fixing the fifth were in progr-ss on the night of August 1. The work wcnt on well till the Four Fluted, when, owing to a sudden jerk, the main chain broke, and the huge girder, weighing about 18 tons, fell to the ground, after having reached an altitude of about 8 feq. As is usual, at the time of the accident there were eight men engaged at the \"crab,\" on the south side of the hill, and in its descent the girder struck three of them, one of whom had his skull ft ightfully smashed. The poor fellows were at once convdyed to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. One of them, after being attended to, was enabled to walk -home. The other two, named-Coppock and Purser, and aged respectively 44 mad 50, are under careful tt eatment. The accident, happening at so early an hour, caused much alarm in the vicinity, the shock being described as tremendous. Much inconvenience was experenced during the morning from the entire stoppage of the traffic.","400345":")n December 10th a most melancholy accident occurred near Falstone Station, on the Border Union Railway, which resulted in the instantaneous death of the driver and stoker of the train to which the accident happened. The following are the particulars of the accident, so far as we have been able to learn :\u2014The morning through goods train from Newcastle to Edin- burgh, consisting of an engine, 22 loaded trucks, and a guard's van, was approaching Falktone, about 17 miles from Riccarton, between 11 and 12 o'clock on Saturday, at a rate of about four miles an hour, when one of the sets of wheels went on to the rails le iding to a coil siding., and the other set remained on the main line. After running for a very short distance, the eng'ne started entirely off the rails, and almost imme- diately sunk in the ground. Toe impetus of the heavy waggons behind forced the tender right on to the top of the engine, and the consequence was that Peter Young, the driver, and William Morris, the stoker,were crushed to death instantaneously. Robert Aitchison, the guard of the train, escaped unhurt. As soon as the accident took place information was telegraphed to Elexham, from which terminus an engine was immediately dispatched. When the Hexham engine reached the scene of the accident a chain was attached between it and the tender above the other engine, and the tender was dragged on to the side of the line. Then the sad results of the catastrophe became painfully apparent. Young, the driver, was found stand- ing with the steam handle in his hand, and this position was the only clue to his identification, as his head had been literally smashed flat by the fall of the tender upon it. The body of the stoker was found lying against the fire box, and it presented a most me- lancholy And fearful spectacle, one of the sides of the face having been almost entirely burnt off. Besides the information sent to Hexham, a telegram was de- spatched to the headquarters at Edinburgh, whence a special train was immediately dispatched with some of the officials, besides a body of workmen from St. Margaret's, who took with them a crane to lift the engine. As soon as this train reached the spot the crane was put in requisition, and the engine and tender were lifted and conveyed to Riccarton. Peter Young, the driver, was 38 years of age, and resided at Restal- rig, where he has lea a widow and three children to lament his untimely end. He had been about 15 years in the company's service, and bore an excellent cha- racter. William Morris, the stoker, was formerly a driver on the Perth and Inverness Railway. He entered the service of the North British Company about six weeks ago, and he was acting as stoker till he had acquired a sufficient knowledge of the line to enable him to take the post of driver. He also was married, and has left a widow and two or three children in Inverness.","430206":"TREESMOST AFFECTED EY LIGHTNING. - Fig trees and cedars are rarely struck by lightning; the beech, larch, fir, and chesnut are obnoxious to it; but the trees whish attract it most are the oak, yew, and Lom- bardy poplar.

COLLISION ow THE GREENWICH LINE.\u2014On Dec 19, an accident occurred on the Greenwich line, and, like the one in Blackheath tunnel, through a failure in the signalling. The scene of this fresh accident was the junction where the Greenwich line diverges a short dis`ance from New Cross, at which spot, shortly before eight o'clock, an engine was on the up-line preparing to run on the metals of the North Sent line, when the passenger train from Greenwich came up, and a collision was the consequence. The driver and stoker of the passenger train were much injured, as were some of the passengers, and it was rumoured that one of the two men on the other engine was killed. The extent of the accident cannot, however, be learnt, for the company's servants refuse to give any information, and the public have to choose between two stories\u2014one that twenty people were seriously injured, the other that only a few persons were bruised. The driver and stoker of the passenger train were conveyed to Guy's Hospital. The cause of this accident is stated to have \u2022arisen from the signal \"All clear\" being given at the last point which the passenger train passed, and the driver was proceed- ing in perfect security through a dense fog which then prevailed until the very moment when the train came into collision with the engine. The traffic was resumed soon after the accident. VERDICT OF MANSLAUGHTER AGAINST A CHEMIST.\u2014 The inquest on Mr. Samuel Crowther, photographer, ' and his son, who were killed by an explosion while the former was manufacturing gas from manganese and chlorate of potass, on Dgcember 17, has taken place. The evidence was to the effect that he was making the gas for Mr. Morgan, optician, when the explosion took placed, the manganese he was using being obtained from Mr. Hughes, a chemist. Professor Roscoe had examined this manganese, and, according to his evi- dence, it contained 25 per cent. of pulverized coal or soot, which he said would render the mixture of the manganese with chlorate of potass as\u2022dangerous as gun- powder. The jury found a verdict of \"Manslaughter against Mr. Hughes,\" and Mr. Herford, the coroner, committed him for trial, but afterwards admitted him to bail.","333683":"The record of fatal accidents on the railroads in Eng- land, which is published annually, with the other statistics of the railway system, presents a terrible total, however small a proportion the sum may bear to the great number of persons who during the year are borne over the lines of the United Kingdom in perfectsafety.

The case was a very peauliar one. The accident took place at Copley Hill, Leeds, so far back as Oct. 16, 1867, but it was not till November, 1863, that plaintiff was permanently disabled.

The question in dispute was -whether the paralysis resulted from the accident. The defendants contended that it was too remote from the time of the collision to have been caused by it, and the fact that the plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel about the country and deliver addresses, night after night, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible Society, was relied on in proof of this. On the other side it was maintained that from the time of the acci- dent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the final seizure, and that there was a continuity of symptoms throughout.

The ordinary coupling consists of draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws' so as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train close together. There are also safety chains, one on each side of the main coupling. The improvement comes into action the moment the engine or tender happens to diverge at a certain angle from the line of railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of gear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are driven back by the springs into the void left by the draw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are instantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame of the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com- pletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears that accidents from engines running off the rails amount to more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci- dents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the Ist of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from this cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas- sengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861 there were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas- sengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862 there were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and 282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci- dents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail- way, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and injury to 161 persons, making together in the course of 3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running off the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63 persons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons, besides involving destruction of rolling stock and large surna for compensation. This indicates to some extent the advantage of adopting the system of coupling patented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia- ment-street, and which appears to be very complete in every respect for the purpose intended. It is in course of being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains en the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from that cause have heretofore been rather more frequent than on other railways A full-sized model of the apparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament- street, which will enable those who are interested in preventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It is rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of railways have no power to require the adoption of any improvement that might appear to them calculatedito prevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although they have power to prevent the opening of a railway for traffic until all the requirements as to the stability of the works and the efficiency of the signals have been fully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the railway department of the Board of Trade.","448426":"ACCIDENTS IN OCAL MINES.

The improvement comes into action the moment the engine or tender happens to diverge at a certain angle from the line of railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of gear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are driven back by the springs into the void left by the draw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are instantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame of the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com- pletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears that accidents from engines running off the rails amount to more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci- dents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the Ist of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from this cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas- sengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861 there were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas- sengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862 there were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and 282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci- dents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail- way, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and injury to 161 persons, making together in the course of 3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running off the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63 persons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons, besides involving destruction of rolling stock and large surna for compensation. This indicates to some extent the advantage of adopting the system of coupling patented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia- ment-street, and which appears to be very complete in every respect for the purpose intended. It is in course of being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains en the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from that cause have heretofore been rather more frequent than on other railways A full-sized model of the apparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament- street, which will enable those who are interested in preventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It is rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of railways have no power to require the adoption of any improvement that might appear to them calculatedito prevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although they have power to prevent the opening of a railway for traffic until all the requirements as to the stability of the works and the efficiency of the signals have been fully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the railway department of the Board of Trade.","1841":"Mr. nrEoTeEbusTAMwoNiIIIALb e upbrsoes rei loaedd of the Acoldtleerrms,acnomFipsahieliv.. wiTllhbee loasregae ftoorthbyatthgeonatdiemmitaeoraf toO brdoaain\u2022ycitilh( eFedniodgcacyah)sai Obnly, and the Master Cutler (Mr. Mark Firth) will preside.

ACCIDENT ON THE NORTH BRITISH RAILWAY.\u2014An accident befel the Glasgow goods trains which left the Waverley Bridge station at 7.10 a.m. on Saturday morning. It appears that when near Gogar station a waggon spring gave way, and the waggon almost im- mediately afterwards left the rails. Fortunately the other waggons kept the metals, although the train ran nenrly a quarter of a mile before the accident was ob- set vad, and the train could be stopped. Very little damage was done, consi,'ering,, the narrow escape the whole train had of being thrown off the rails. Assist- ance was immediz,tely procured, and after a delay of up, ards of two hours the wag-ion was removed, the traffic during this time being carried on, with more or less delay, on the up-line of rails between Gogar and Corstorphine. The fast passenger train leaving Waverley Bridge station at ten o'clock was delayed forty minutes, much to the annoyance of the passengers. No GAOWb injured by the accident.

Several witnesses were called, the effact of whose evidence was to show that the engine got off the line through some defect in the way. Some of the witnesses stated that the engines called Crampton's patent had a damaging effect on the line, and it was shown that the line at the spot where the accident happened was frequently out of repair. Colonel Yolland said he attended by the instructions of the Board of Trade. Ile would not say what had been the actual cause of the accident, but he would Say what his opinion was from the evidence he had heard. He thought the evidence had been truthfully given. He believed that both the first and second rails spoken of by Mr. Mills had been forced out by a heavy lurch of the engine, and probably the carriages got off after they had passed the spot. He did not think that one key being out would have caused the accident. The jury, after deliberating an hour, returned the following verdict :\u2014' We find that the deceased, Wm. Reed, came to his death by accident; and we believe that the engine left the rails in consequence of the de\u2022 fective state of the road, which we consider mainly attributable to the use of the engines called 'Cramp- ton's patent.\"' The Comner said that was equivalent to a verdict of accidental death. He would take that opportunity of stating that no sort of imputation rested on the de- ceased Witham Reed. His character had been beyond reproach, and he had been the best driver in the company's employ. Mr. Martley said he might state that the Govern- ment were making those arrangements respecting their engines which would most conduce to the safety of the public. The inquiry then terminated. ","387243":"RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.\u2014On the order for going into a Committee of supply, Mr. Bentinck moved a resolution that, \"in consequence of the frequency and increasing number of accidents on railways, and the absence of any power in the executive Government to interfere for their better prevention it is desirable that power should be vested by Act of Parliament in the Board of Trade, or in some other department of the Government, to in- stitute an inquiry into the causes of any accidents whith may occur on railways, and examine witnesses on oath; and that powers should be vested in such department to frame and issue regulations for the conduct of the traffic on railways for the safety and convenience of the public.\"\u2014The motion was seconded by Mr. Jackson. \u2014Mr. Thompson opposed the resolution. The first part, he said, was unnecessary, as the Board of Trade now bad power to institute inquiries, and the second part, which proposed to vest in the Board power to frame regulations, would lead to divided responsibility, and increase the number of accidents.\u2014Sir F. Smith could not go the whole length of the resolution, which would throw upon the Government the responsibility which now rested upon the railway compani( s.\u2014Mr. M. Gibson said he thought the first pert of the resolu- tion unnecessary, as the present system of inquiry was succestlul in arcertaining the cause of the accident, and, with regard to the other portion, a Royal Com- mission was appointed, which would inquire into and report upon the -subject, so it would be premature for the House to agree to the motion.\u2014After further ob- servations by Mr. Lefroy and Mr. R.

Mime, an Independent minister, formerly in charge of a con- gregation at Tintwistle, but now residing at South- port, sued the London and North-Western Railway Company for damages. in consequende of a railway accident. The case was a very peculiar one. The accident took place at Copley Hill, Leeds, so far back as Oct. 16, 1867, but it was not till November, 1868, that plaintiff was permanently. disabled. in the meantime he had been engaged ,as local secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society .at a salary of \u00a33OO per year, and travelled about the country, de- livering addresses on its behalf. On November 12, 1868, thirteen months after the accident,'he \"had, a paralytic attack which rendered him so complete a wreck that his evidence had to be taken by commis- sion. The question in dispute - was whether the paralysis resulted from the accident. The defendants contended that it was too remote from the time of the collision to have been caused by it, and the fact that the plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel about the country and deliver addresses, night after night, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible Bociety, was relied on in proof of this. On the other side it was maintained that from the time of the acci- dent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the final seizure, and that there was a continuity of Symptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were called on each side who directly contradicted each other as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The judge, in summing up, said the plaintiff was clearly entitled to damages for the sufferings he had under- gone since the time of the accident, but he could give no assistance as to the real point at issue. After a consultation of twenty minutes, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014Damages \u00a32,000. ","403070":"The annual return from the Board of Trade concern- ing the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued. It exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase for 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be in mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several items of income and expenditure. The statistics are gigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to illustrate with important truthfulness the immense results which are identified with the railway system of this country, and how these results spring from the necessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485 passengers travelled on the railways in England and Wales, which, taking the population at something under 22,000,000 would give an aver- age of say eight journeys for each individual. From these returns we cull the following statistics of the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of December, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way open, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying 173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those who held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991. In connection with the passengers, there were carried at the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and 327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following great reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of coal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of general merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833 cattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also carried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081 miles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains was 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the passenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods traffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all sources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822. It is an important point to consider how this wonder- ful system of traffic has been performed in respect of the s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the recurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the actual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to estimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met with accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger trains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were killed and 371 injured. The total number of passen- gers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to trains during 1863 on all railways in England and Wales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129 people kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on railways, including trespassers and people killed or injured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa- tion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the general statistics, which may be divided into a more particular form. On the London and North-Western 19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season- ticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen- gers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as compensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts from pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods traffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi- ture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts \u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221 passengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets. There were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his own m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be- yond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as compensation for personal injuries. The receipts were: From passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196. The proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per cent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were 11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four accidents took place, by which 7 passengers were killed and 33 received injuries, which cost the company \u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re- ceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods; the working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net income \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515 passengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1 assenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age for working on this line was 50, and the total gross income \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These returns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan I:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to illustrate the working of the purely provincial under- takings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried during 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from whom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the goods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross income of \u00a31,778,261.

Carter managed to keep in the skip, and was drawn to the top of the shaft, but he was severely burnt on the arms and face. The banksman (George Spink) was thrown several yards from his post, but was not hurt. The barricading on the first landing was blown completely away, several planks falling into the shaft.

The engine fell on its right side, and by a moit fortunate accident the driver was thremn in`o an adjoining meadow, where ho sustain, d only temporary injuries. The stoker, who most probably was attending to his break, was less fortunate, and, falling with the engine, was buriol under it, and his body ha i not been extrlcated at six o'clock last evening. The guard, who was travelling in a tender immediattly behind the engine, Fu ffered severe contusions, but a pro- jecting girder saved his lire, and he escaped through one of the windows of his van. The crash was heard by the Beckenham junction Signalmen, and at the earliest mameet messengers were despatched for assistance, all traffic up and down the line being stopped. The means at hand were quite in- effectual, but before 7 o'clock Mr. Mills, rtsident engineer of the line, and Mr. Manley, 1 )comotive superintendent, Were upon the spot. A cursory examination showed that he foundations of the bridge had been serieusly affected by the late floods, and that the portion of the structure carrying the down rails had given way either immediately before or at the moment the last goals train was in the act of passing over it. The engine-driver, who was on the spot, and sufficiently callected to give his version of the disaster, stated that just h)fore the accident he was going on \"as comfortably as could be,\" and that the next moment be found himself thrown into she adjoining meadow. Mr. Mills, after surveying the state \u2022 of the bridge at once decided that the firs: thing to be accomplished was to secure in a perfectly safe c eadi, ion the remaining line of metals, so that the traffic of the railway might not be interrupted, the outside down rail alone having been destroyed by the accident. To this end the exertions of a large body of labourers were de- voted during the whole of Send iy, and there appeared to be reatonable hope that this result would be accomplished before midnight. The ordinary traffic of the railway on Sunday was carried on by train.) on either side of the bridge, the passengers alighting north or south of the scene of the accident and walking over the partially destroyed bridge, no through train having passed either above or below the Beckenham junt'ion. The accident is attributed to the swol!en state of the tributary stream Passing beneath the bridge. In ordinary weather this stream merely carries off the drainage of the flit ponds of Mr. Hoare, the banker, and Mr. Fortescue, re\u2022idents in the neighbourhood, but the recent heavy snow-storm and rapid thaw have converted an ordinary rivulet into a rushing river, the force of which, it is feared, has weakened the foundations of the bridge, and hence the disaster. It is proper to state that the foreman of the permanent way for the district had speciaqy exa- mined this bridge at four o'clock on Saturday af:ernoon, when, as far as be could judge, everything appeared to him to be in a perfectly safe condition ","56971":"A few days ago a serious accident occurred in Bulmer village to a pic-nic party going to Castle Howard.

Carttar, coroner for West Kent, resumed and concluded an inquiry at the Pier Tavern, Elite, on March 13, relative to the melam_holy accident which occurred by the upsetting of a boat in the Thames on the 28th February, in consequence of which ten cadets, belonging to the training ship Worcester, lost their lives. Mr. Henry Green, chairman; Mr. Chamberlain, deputy chairman; Mr. Bullivant, seretary ; and other gentlemen connected with the seciety, attended to watch the proceedings, and the inquest room was crowded. Mr. Tipple, surgeon, of Erith, said that he saw the body of the deceased Cadet Harrison immediately after it was landed. Death was caused by drowning. Benjamin Joseph Beckwith, aged 17, cadet on board the Worcester training ship, explained how the boat got capsized. The incidents are already well known. Witness jumped into the river as the boat was turning over, and was afterwards picked up. He could swim, and when he rose on the top of the water he saw some of the other lads swimming, and heard one cry out that he had got the cramp. The boys were not looking over the side of the boat, and there was no larking going on. Witness had known the boat eight or nine months, and considered that she was an excellent boat in every respect. When the boat was wearing Cashman told one of the lads to loosen the foresail, and he let it go. This had nothing to with the accident, and would rather tend to have prevented it. By the jury: Johnson, the cadet who was lost whilst trying to save others, could swim. All the cadets were trained to The art of swimming. James Awdry, another cadet, aged 16, gave corrobo- rative evidence, and in reply to the coroner said he could not tell why the boat capsized. At the time of the accident the head of the boat was towards the north shore. Witness could swim, and was swimming when he was picked up. After she capsized the boat partly righted herself again, and a great many of the cadets were clinging to her, when she turned over again completely. James Palmer, a cadet, gave similar evidence. Captain George Whitby, commander of the Worces- ter, was then examined, and said he saw the three boats leave the vessel. The boat which capsized was the largest. It was purchased by the society in Sep- tember last from the Boat Building Company at East Greenwich. She was 29 feet long, 6 feet 7 inches in the beam, and appeared to be an excellent boat in every respect. Cashman, the boatswain, was in charge of this boat. Cashman joined the ship in August last. He had previouily had many years' experience, and witness had always considered him to be a most efficient as he was a most trustworthy man. He first received information of the a,ccident from a screw steamer, which hailed him when going down the river. By the Coroner: He never sent ballast in the boat ; he did not approve of that plan\u2014in fact, considered it dangerous, and that many lives had been lost by placing ballast in bolts. The majority of the cadets on board the Worcester could swim. He inspected the sails of the boat when they were being made. He did not think that the boat was over-canvassed. The sails were made of very light canvas. James Sims, a waterman, of Greenwich, who was near the spot where the accident took place, in his boat, said: Immediately before she capiz, d he saw that the boat was on the starboard tack, with her head right down. He saved three persons, and got the deceased Cadet Harrison into his boat, but he appeared then to be lifeless. He saved Cashman, who called out, \"Never mind me; I am all right; save the others.\" He did not think that the boat could have turned quite keel upwards, as the sails would not have allowed it. The wind was fresh. Witness never carried ballast in his boat, and did not approve of that plan. The men who had charge of the two other boats were examined, but their testimony was unimportant. John Cashman, the boatswain in charge of the cap- sized boat (having been duly cautioned by the coroner), said he wished to state all that he knew respecting the accident. He had been nineteen years is. her Majesty's service before he joined the 'Worcester. Immediately preceding this engagement he was a gunner on board the President training-ship for the Naval Reserve. After repeating the evidence given as to the arrival of the boat at Crossness Point, the witness said: When one of the cadets lost his cap, be told a lad named Holmes to ea.e the foresheet, and Holmes let go the sheet altogether. That rather helped witness than otherwise in the movement he intended to make in order to get the cap. Up to the time of tbo accident the boat had behaved well, and had not shipped more ' than a quart of water. Before the accident he was on the port tack, standing over to the opposite shore. He wore the boat about till she came round on the starboard tack, when the wind took her on the starboard quarter, and she went down instantly. He could not account for the boat going over in any way. By the Jury: She was keel uppermost before he told the cadets to cling to her; finding there was no other chance he called out to the cadets in the water, \"Strike out for the boat,\" and he believed they all did so. There were not too many lads in the boat; hstd there been a few more the accident might not have happened, as thep would have acted as ballast. He did not approve of taking ballast in the boat. Now that the accident bn taken place, he thought it would be better that the keel of the boat should be a little deepened. He had always considered her a very safe boat. The jury, without consultation, returned a verdict of \"Accidental death.\" ","461079":"MARYLEBONB INDUSTRIAL Exiinurfozr.\u2014A prelimi- nary meeting in connection with the above was held yesterday at the Portland street school room,.

Ac.idents on a great scale do not ex- cite so much sensation in America as in England, owing to the area of the country, the varieties of risk, and greater recklessness of temperament. With thousands on thousands of miles of river navigation, in wild, half-deserted territory, careful inspection or care- ful msnagement is impossible; elaborate precautions would be costly, if not impossible; people, therefore, make up their minds to accidents. Much the same may be said of railrcads. The alternative has been a great number of cheaply and hastily constructed roads, worked at low fares, or a very few expensive and care- fully Managed lines for short distances. People chose the former, and when casualties come bear them as soldiers bear the losses of a victory. With mining accidents the people are less familiar, no mines reach the depth of the English mines; but there is no Govern- ment inspection, and no legally enforced precautions are taken. The late accident occurred in a mine with but one shaft, and round the mouth of the shaft there was a large pile of wcoden buildings, containing stores, hoisting machinery, and so on, dry as tinder under the lo::g drought. It caught fire, and the fire communica- ted with the mine; and, there being no other outlet, even for ventilation, the men were crowded into one corner, and miserably perished.","461077":"MARYLEBONB INDUSTRIAL Exiinurfozr.\u2014A prelimi- nary meeting in connection with the above was held yesterday at the Portland street school room,.

FATAL ACCIDENT TO A MARQUIS.\u2014The Florence journals contain accounts of a frightful accident on the fashionable promenade of the Cascine. A number of carriages were drawn up on the open space known as the Piazzone, a favourite rendezvous in which gentle- men are accustomed to proceed from one equipage to another chatting with their friends, or presenting their compliments to ladies of their acquaintance. The Marquis Alessandro Covino was standing at the door of the Countess Gherardi's landau, when the horses of another vehicle taking fright, started off, and before the Marquis could get out of the way, knocked him down, and so fearfully injured him with their hoofs that he expired a few minutes after. The deceased was about forty years of age, and the pos- sessor of a handsome fortune. SMOCKING ACCIDENT AT LLANDUDNO.\u2014This water- ing place was on the 18th inst. the scene of a shocking accident. About five o'clock a jeweller named Griffiths, aged 35 years, left his residence with a friend for the purpose of taking a walk round the Ormeshead. When about two miles round Mr. Griffiths dropped his walking stick down the bank, and while descend- ing in search of it he lost his hold and began rolling down. His companion went to his aid, and found him clinging to a piece of rock that overhangs a precipice. He gave Mr. Griffiths his handkerchief as a support until aid could be received, but the poor man could not retain his hold many moments, and, letting go, he was dashed on the rocks nearly twenty yards below. The alarm was given in the town, and police-serjeant Jones, with four boatmen, took a boat to the spot. The body was found dreadfully mangled, and brought to the town. Deceased has left a wife and three children to mourn his loss. OPENING OF NEW RAGGED SCHOOLS AT WALWORTH.\u2014 On the 19th inst. new ragged schools were opened in Lock's-fields, Walworth.

AN OMNIBUS COLLISION.\u2014On the 19th inst. one of the Birmingham Omnibus Company's omnibuses was proceeding down Dale End, when it came in violent collision with a horse and trap belonging to a fish- monger. A boy, named William Mills, was in the trap at the time, and was precipitated to the ground, the trap was upset, and the horse thrown down. With the exception of a strained wrist, the boy received no injury; but the horse had one of its legs broken, and it was afterwards found necessary to destroy the it ni mal. The omnibus and its occupants entirely escaped in- jury. A notice of a recent steamboat explosion in America ends as follows :\u2014\" The captain swath ashore. So did the chambermaid.

It seems that William Todd, aged 26, his brother Enfield Todd, aged about 20, and another bea,chmart, mimed Samuel E. Fleming, 20, proceeded out of the harbour in a new boat, tor \"the purpose of drawing for some smelts and other fish along the shore. Just as they reached tho bar, and precisely where the late life boat catastrophe took place, their small omit was caught by a sea and swamped. The men were thrown into the water, and being heavily attired, two of them sank and were drowmed ; while Enfield Todd manit,ged to extricate himself, and swam to the beach. The accident was observed from the north pier by some pilots, and they at once launched a boat and proceeded to the scene of the disaster, but too late to be of service. Subsequently the boat was picked up, and the body of the elder Todd was found entangled in the netting. The tide was low on the bar at the time ot the accident. Twenty-five beaehmen have been drowned in Yarmouth river since January last.","265770":"In one notion\u2014the only one\u2014ag Einst the North- London Beltway, the verdict was in revour of the com- pany, it appearing that the accident arose from the pas- senger having alighted from the train while it was in I motion. Here there was no contributory negligenee (as. 1 is not unfrequently alleged in some cases of this kind) on the part at the company's servants. The acc'dent, it appeared, arose entirely from the passenger's own rashness. Against the London and 13.ighton Company there was but one action' which was brought by the widow of a labourer who had been killed on the line. A verdict, in that case was given against thc company for \u00a3l5O. The London, Chatham, and Dover Company also had but one action against them brought to trial. That was a case of personal injury by collision, and the damages awarded were \u00a3250. There were three actions against the Great Eastern Company, in which the damages given were respectively \u00a34OO, \u00a32OO, mad \u00a32OO. Against the South Eastern there Were three actions\u2014one arising out of the accident in Blackheath tunnel, in December, 1864, and in respect of which a verdict passed against the company for \u00a31,200; and two others, which arose out of the Staplehurst accident iu June last. One of these, in which \u00a34OO damages were awardedr was brought by a father and mother for the loss of a son, in whom they had a pecuniary interest, and who had been killed by an accident on the company's line. The other action was for injuries sustained by a. husl- and and. wife. The husband being a clergyman. In this case it appeared that the medical expenses alone amounted to \u00a35OO. The verdict against the company, who, upon the question, of negligence did not deny their liability, was for \u00a34,500. The Great Western Company were deferldants in five actions one by a widow for the loss of her husband,, an engineer, earning \u00a35OO a year, in which a verdict was taken, by consent, for \u00a31,850; the others were for personal injuries,, in one of which the verdict was for the company. In the others, the damag( s given were respectively \u00a35,775, \u00a31,600, and \u00a3702 10s. In the only action against the Bristol and Exettr Railway a verdict, by consent, was given for \u00a32,262. Against the Midland Company thee were feta astions ; in one of which a verd;ct was given for \u00a3BOO, in respect of a per- sonal injury arising out of the collision last year at Colney Hatch, where, it will be remembered, 300 passengers were more or less injured. In the second action (also for a personal injury) the verdict was for \u00a3250. In the other two cases the company obtained the verdicts. The London and North-Western Company were defendants in 14 actions\u2014one for loss of lifer in which the verdict was for the company, it appearing that the acci- dent occurred through the paesengers own incaution. In two other cases the company were successful. In one of them it was proved that the parties (husband and wife) had before they brought the action agreed to accept a certain sum ( which was paid to them by the company) in full for their claim. This fact, which was pleaded in bar to the action, put them at once out of court. Another of these 14 cases was an action by a widow for the loss of her husband, a carter, who met his death by an accident on the line, leaving two children. The verdict given in that case was for \u00a33OO. The other ten cases against this company arose out of personal in- juries. The verdicts were respectively for \u00a34,000, \u00a33,500, \u00a3B5O, \u00a3BOO, \u00a3550, \u00a3525, \u00a35OO, \u00a34OO, \u00a3225, and \u00a3225. Against the London and South Western Company there were three actions\u2014one for the loss of a wife who was killed by an accident on the S disbury line, and in which a verdict was given for \u00a3500; one for a personae injury, in 'which \u00a3550 was awarded, and one in which the verdict was given in favour of the company. The South Devon Company were defendants in one action only, which was for a personal injury, and in which \u00a3550 damages were given. The Great Northern aho had but one action against it, and in that, for a personal injury, \u00a3450 was awarded. There were seven actions against the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company, six for personal injuries, and one for loss of life. The verdicts in the six cases were re- spectively for \u00a3l,OOO, \u00a3450, \u00a33OO, \u00a3250, \u00a32OO, and \u00a375. In the other, by a widow, for the loss of her husband, leaving six children, the damages awarded were \u00a3750. Against the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Com- pany there were two actions, in one of which, brought by a mother for the loss of a son, in whom she had a pe- cuniary interest, the verdict was for \u00a32OO. The other was a case of personal injury, in which the damages given were \u00a3450.

The ordinary coupling consists of draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws' so as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train close together. There are also safety chains, one on each side of the main coupling. The improvement comes into action the moment the engine or tender happens to diverge at a certain angle from the line of railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of gear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are driven back by the springs into the void left by the draw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are instantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame of the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com- pletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears that accidents from engines running off the rails amount to more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci- dents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the Ist of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from this cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas- sengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861 there were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas- sengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862 there were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and 282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci- dents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail- way, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and injury to 161 persons, making together in the course of 3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running off the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63 persons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons, besides involving destruction of rolling stock and large surna for compensation. This indicates to some extent the advantage of adopting the system of coupling patented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia- ment-street, and which appears to be very complete in every respect for the purpose intended. It is in course of being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains en the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from that cause have heretofore been rather more frequent than on other railways A full-sized model of the apparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament- street, which will enable those who are interested in preventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It is rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of railways have no power to require the adoption of any improvement that might appear to them calculatedito prevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although they have power to prevent the opening of a railway for traffic until all the requirements as to the stability of the works and the efficiency of the signals have been fully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the railway department of the Board of Trade.","795782":"HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES.---Thil ! board of management of the Warehousemen and Clerks' Schools have the honour to announce that his Royal Highness the Prince of' Wales has graciously consented to lay the foundation stone of the new building for 150 orphans.

The question in dispute - was whether the paralysis resulted from the accident. The defendants contended that it was too remote from the time of the collision to have been caused by it, and the fact that the plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel about the country and deliver addresses, night after night, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible Bociety, was relied on in proof of this. On the other side it was maintained that from the time of the acci- dent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the final seizure, and that there was a continuity of Symptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were called on each side who directly contradicted each other as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The judge, in summing up, said the plaintiff was clearly entitled to damages for the sufferings he had under- gone since the time of the accident, but he could give no assistance as to the real point at issue. After a consultation of twenty minutes, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014Damages \u00a32,000. ","403068":"The annual return from the Board of Trade concern- ing the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued. It exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase for 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be in mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several items of income and expenditure. The statistics are gigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to illustrate with important truthfulness the immense results which are identified with the railway system of this country, and how these results spring from the necessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485 passengers travelled on the railways in England and Wales, which, taking the population at something under 22,000,000 would give an aver- age of say eight journeys for each individual. From these returns we cull the following statistics of the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of December, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way open, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying 173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those who held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991. In connection with the passengers, there were carried at the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and 327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following great reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of coal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of general merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833 cattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also carried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081 miles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains was 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the passenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods traffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all sources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822. It is an important point to consider how this wonder- ful system of traffic has been performed in respect of the s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the recurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the actual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to estimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met with accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger trains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were killed and 371 injured. The total number of passen- gers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to trains during 1863 on all railways in England and Wales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129 people kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on railways, including trespassers and people killed or injured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa- tion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the general statistics, which may be divided into a more particular form. On the London and North-Western 19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season- ticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen- gers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as compensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts from pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods traffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi- ture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts \u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221 passengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets. There were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his own m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be- yond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as compensation for personal injuries. The receipts were: From passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196. The proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per cent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were 11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four accidents took place, by which 7 passengers were killed and 33 received injuries, which cost the company \u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re- ceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods; the working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net income \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515 passengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1 assenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age for working on this line was 50, and the total gross income \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These returns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan I:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to illustrate the working of the purely provincial under- takings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried during 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from whom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the goods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross income of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of expenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits \u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21 passengers were injured, but none fatally.

The party made the journey in an omnibusy and it seems that the wife of one of the men hesitated to join the party, and tried to persuade her husband not to go, because she had dreamt a week before that they were in an omnibus and were upset on going through a village and greatly injured, fright awaken.. ing her. The man and his wife, however, did go, but on reaching Bulmer the woman beoame greatly ex- cited. Not only, she remarked, was the omnibus that which she had seen in her dream, but the village Wad that in which the accident she dreamt of happened. The words were scarcely uttered when the omnibuil was upset, and a scene of great confusion resulted. Those on the outside were thrown to the ground with great violence; one man was rendered insensible by the omnibus falling upon him, and several sustained rather serious injuries. The woman to whom the accident was revealed beforehand was herself badly hurt, but her husband's was the worst case, he sun% taming a dislocation of an ankle. Medical aid wail quickly procured, the sufferers were relieved, and afterwards conveyed to their homes. Every incident of the accident seems to have been pictured in th. premonitory dream.","611158":"An action of a novel character, ani one which is likely to have an important effect upon future railway accidents; was opened before the Holywell magistrates on the 6th inst. The complainant was Mr. Edwards Woods, the solicitor who has taken a prominent part in the Abergele prosecutions, and the defendant was George Grinnett, signalman at the Holy-well station on the London and North Western Railway. The offence charged as stated in the summons was that the defendant did unlawfully, wilfully, and negligently omit to do a certain act\u2014to wit, to put up the sema- phore signal danger to show that the lino was not clear at Holywell station at the time the express train leav- ing Chester at 2.45 p.m. was due to pass through, at which time a goods train was standing on the down line, causing the express to run into collision with the goods train, whereby the life and limbs of Mr. Edwards Woods, and the life and limbs of other pas- sengers, were endangered. Mr. Woods said the com- plaint which the bench would be asked to hear was preferred by himself against the defendant, who was a signalman at Holywell station on the 16th day of September. The proceedings were taken under the 3rd and 4th Vic., cap. 97, sec. 13. Mr. Woods having described in detail the accident and the injuries which he alleged himself to have sustained, Mr. Ellis Eyton proceeded to cross-examine him. In reply to various questions, Mr. Woods said\u2014l hardly remember what train I went down to Holywell by on the morning of the accident. I think I went down by the noon train, but lam not sure. I am certain I was in the train when the accident happened. The first step I took was to summon the station=master, Mr. Jones. I did not obtain the summons in this court. What I did was under the advice of Mr. Lenge, the magistrates' clerk at Rhyl. I .entirely disclaim any personal motives in this prosecution. After the accident I went on to Rhyl, and telegraphed an account of it to the Times newspaper and the Daily Telegraph. I wrote another letter to the Times enclosing a letter, which had been forwarded to me praising me for my conduct in the Abergele case. Mr. Eyton was proceeding ta cross-examine Mr. Woods as to-his doings at Abergele, but this line of cross-examination was objected to. Mr. Edwards Woods called Mr. Jones, station-master at Holywell, who cited a rule of the company's service with reference to the proper working of signals, and Mr. Stretton, inspector of police upon the line, proved that he had supplied the defendant with a copy of the rules. Mr. Hughes, who temporarily filled the office of station-master at Holywell during the absence of 7sfr. Jones, who was on his holiday at the time of the acci- dent, stated that the semaphore signal was up. two minutes before the express was due. The down line was not clear at the time the 2.40 p.m. train arrived, and a collision occurred. Cross-examined.\u2014The 2.40 train id not timed to stop at Holywell, but as a matter of fact it had stopped for some time previously for the purpose of taking water. On an average it stops at Holywell two or three times a week. I was standing in the middle of the platform when the expret;i passed through, and the trucks which were being shunted, and with which the express came into collision, stood about 200 yards further on. When the express passed me it was going at the rate of about 12 miles an hour. The guards were applying the breaks hard, and by the time the train reached the trucks the speed was re- duced by one-half. I went up to the carriages upon the accident taking place, but did not find anyone hurt. None of the passengers complained to me of injuries. I do not know whether I saw the complainant there. I think I did. John Naylor, engine driver of the ex- press' said\u2014When I approached Holywell I saw that both the distance signal and the semaphore were at danger. I saw them about a mile off. On seeing the distance signal I shut off steam and prepared to stop the train. I whistled and both signals were lowered as a sign that all was right. I had not then reached the distance signal. I thereupon put on steam and proceeded. The train was not timed to stop at Holy- well. When I got inside the station I saw a person waving his hands to me to stop. I then shut off steam and reversed the engine, and did all I could to stop. At this time I was going at the rate of 30 miles an hour. The semaphore signal was down at this moment. I am sure of that, for when I saw the hand waving, I looked up to the signal. I did not see any portion of the obstructing train till I got close up to it. I saw that one portion of the goods train was on the up-. line, and the other on the down. I ran into them broadside. The goods train was going tow& Chester, and the driver had drawn it on to the up-line as far as he could get, but there was a passenger train before him, and hi l train was so long that three of the trucks were left on the 'down line in the way of my train. I got on the step of the engine and dropped oil just before the collision took place. I was going at the rate of about 15 miles an hour when the shock oc- curred. This was the case for the plaintiff. For the defence it was urged that the accident was the result of an error of judgment on the part of the defendant, and not of wilful negligence as provided for by the statute. The Chairman dwelt upon the importance of the signalman's duties, and to mark their sense of the heinousness of the prisoner's offence, the bench sen- tenced him to two months' imprisonment, the longest term the law permitted them to' inflict.

The proportion is increasing; the deaths by violence in 10,003 of p )pul s- don ranged from 7.16 to 7.60 in the four years 1851-51 ; from 7.95 to 8.35 in the four years 1861-67. There is no increase of death from murder, manslaughter, or suicide, but in the deaths from accident or negligence the increase is too manifest. In the five years 1863-67 2,391,165 deaths were registered in England and Wales, with the causes of death specified ; and of 83,853, the deaths of 62,708 males and 21,143 females, were violent deaths. It must also be stated that 498 of these males and 123 of the females were intoxicated when the accident or other violence which proved fatal occurred to them. 4,175 of these violent deaths were by railway accidents; 5,898 by accidents in or about mines; 28,114 by mechanical in.] urie4, such as fractures, falls' or being run over; 14,921 by chymical ' irjuries, such as burns scalds, poisoning; 23,823 by asphyxia or suspension of respiration chiefly by drowning or suffocation; 6,896 by violence not particularly de- scribed. The whole number is equal to the popula- tion of a large city, such as Norwich; 19,510 of these violent deaths, not very far from a fourth of the whole number, were deaths of children under 5 years of age; 3,933 children were burnt to death, 3,267 scalded to death, 1,950 drowned, 5,134 suffocated; so difficult is the entrance upon life' 6,696 of the violent deaths were suicides \u20141,905 males, 1791 females; 21 boys and 15 girls under 15 years old committed suicide, most of the boys by hang- ing and most of the girls by drowning\u2014one girl who drowned herself was under 5 years of age; 130 lads and 165 girls between 15 and 20 committed suicide; 252 young men and 163 young women between 20 and 25; 664 men and 272 women between 25 and 35 ; 9 l 9 men and 330 women between 35 and 45; 1,135 men and 382 women between 45 and 55; 1,066 men and 261 women between 55 and 66; 688 men and 203 women above 65. The variation with age in the ratios of the sexes will be observed: The deaths of 630 males and 633 females in the five years are returned as having occurred from murder and infanticide ; 810 whose age was under one month, 874 under one year, 921 under four years\u2014again proving the diffi- rtzlty of entrance upon life. Among the curiosities upon the death roll by violence for the five years these may be instanced :\u2014Two persons, one very old and one very young, killed by game cocks; one person from artificial teeth ; others from swallowing a fish-bone, swallowing a plum-stone, or from the sting of a bee; children from swallowing a pin, a needle, a halfpenny, a nutshell, a bank zone also from the sting of a wasp. _ . _","403075":"The annual return from the Board of Trade concern- ing the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.

The receipts were: From passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196. The proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per cent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were 11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four accidents took place, by which 7 passengers were killed and 33 received injuries, which cost the company \u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re- ceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods; the working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net income \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515 passengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1 assenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age for working on this line was 50, and the total gross income \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These returns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan I:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to illustrate the working of the purely provincial under- takings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried during 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from whom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the goods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross income of \u00a31,778,261.

A large coal traffic is carried on by this company on their North Seaton branch, which seems to be a single line. The train which left Becilington by this branch for North Seaton at a quarter past 8 in the morning, was proceeding to the. latter place, when the engineman descried a coal train, apparently coming up from the pits. The whistle was blown and the engine reversed, and everything clope to avert an accident, but the trains came into collision. Fortunately there i were only five passengers n the train, of whom, how- ever, two ladies named Mrs. and Miss Brewis, mother and daughter, were severely injured. The elder lady had both her legs broken, and the daughter was much cut and bruised. The drivers and firemen of the engines escaped unhurt. The coal train had been shunting at the time the collision occurred, and the signals appear to have been neglected. OATH OF OFFICE.\u2014A Parliamentary return of the oaths required to be taken by any of her Majesty's subjects contains some that are little known, and rather curious. The following is the oath required to be taken by a very high functionary, the Chancellor of the Ex- chequer :\u2014\" Ycu shall swear that well and truly you shall serve the Queen our Sovereign Lady and tier people in the office of Chancellor or Under Treasurer. And you shall do right to all manner of people, poor and rich, of such things as toucheth your office. And the Queen's treasure truly you shall keep and dispend. And truly you shall counsel the Queen, and her counsel you shall lain and keep. And that you shall neither know nor suffer the Queen's hurt, nor her disinheriting.

Hills, the coroner for Chatham, has concluded an investigation into the circumstances connected with the recent shocking accident which occurred in the foundry at Chatham Dockyard, by which Charles Crossland, one of the workmen, lost his life in a most horrible manner. From the evidence of the witnesses examined it appeared that at the time of the accident the workmen, between 30 and 40 in number,, were engaged casting the large brass cleaver, weighing seven tons, to be placed in front of the stem of the Lord Warden ironclad frigate. The whole of the molten metal had been run into the mould, when the sides suddenly gave way, scattering the liquid metal in all directions. The deceased, who was standing in an elevated place, jumped down and attempted to run away, when a large quantity of the hot metal fell in a shower on him, inflicting most horrible injuries, of which, after lingering. about 24 hours, he died. The coroner and jury instituted a searching investigation into the character and strength of the mould, when all the witnesses were unanimous in expressing their opinion that it was constructed of extra strength, and with all possible care, and that the accident was, in fact, inexplicable. It was also stated that it would occupy about six weeks to construct another mould. It ' appeared to be a marvel that there were not more lives sacrificed, as there were several ladies and other spectators present witnessing the operation. The jury, after a lengthened investigation, returned a verdict of \"Accidental death,\" intimating, at the same time, that all possible care had been taken in the construction of thc mould. ","400564":"The object of this contrivance, which consists of a modification of the ordinary coupling, is to cut off the connection between the engine and carriages of a train whenever the engine runs off the rails, so as to prevent the rest of the train being dragged after it over em- bankments or bridges. The ordinary coupling consists of draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws' so as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train close together. There are also safety chains, one on each side of the main coupling. The improvement comes into action the moment the engine or tender happens to diverge at a certain angle from the line of railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of gear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are driven back by the springs into the void left by the draw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are instantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame of the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com- pletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears that accidents from engines running off the rails amount to more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci- dents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the Ist of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from this cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas- sengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861 there were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas- sengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862 there were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and 282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci- dents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail- way, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and injury to 161 persons, making together in the course of 3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running off the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63 persons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons, besides involving destruction of rolling stock and large surna for compensation. This indicates to some extent the advantage of adopting the system of coupling patented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia- ment-street, and which appears to be very complete in every respect for the purpose intended. It is in course of being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains en the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from that cause have heretofore been rather more frequent than on other railways A full-sized model of the apparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament- street, which will enable those who are interested in preventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It is rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of railways have no power to require the adoption of any improvement that might appear to them calculatedito prevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although they have power to prevent the opening of a railway for traffic until all the requirements as to the stability of the works and the efficiency of the signals have been fully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the railway department of the Board of Trade.","637501":";need. , To what' account was the \u00a39OO credited, because ti have told as that the two accounts were kept )arate P\u2014lt would be taken from the trade fount, that exhausted nearly all the funds of the ie; then they called a delegate meeting through ' pamphlet I spoke of, and this delegate meeting .\u00a31:20.

To him labour is but a thing with which the less law interferes to protect the better. True to his politico- economic creed, he gets as much salary and does as little for it as he can. He never visits a pit when he dares to stop away. He never makes a tour of inspection to see the law is observed to prevent accidents; and, when sent for by the men's fears, either notice is sent of his coming, or some hint is given about the complaint, so that when a flying visit is made there is nothing to see, and the men get a rebuke, or a discharge. Thus, the men object to report or complain of danger. 'There are scores of pits in Yorkshire that the -inspector has never once been into; and hundreds of men who neither know his face nor his address. The inspector is bound to attend all inquests of death from accident's in pits held in this dis- trict; he does not always do even that, or he comes to view long after all traces of accident, or rather of the causes, are carefully removed. And the result is, whereas in the Factories' In- ' spection Act, detection of breach of law before accidents, and of punishment accordingly, are ' frequent, under the Mines' Inspection Act breaches of law before accidents are never heard of, and but very rarely convictions or punishment, when accidents have occurred,. that is, so far as employers are concerned. But woe be to the poor miner who is either caught slipping, or if even the idea of a slip can be detected. The- inspector then is truly a terror, and his wrath is something awful. He carefully avticls having anything to do with the men, and if a aeputation venture to seek an interview, he appoints his own house, per- haps miles away, and therefore, practically, a bar to workmen going. And if even that be got over, all that cold shoulder officialism, and the most offensive red.tapeism, can show is shown. Formali*l4.,riect, ' and 'even _icule and nairgiffhe eWrience of parties who have once sought his presence by appoint- ment; and we leave the reader to judge whether an independent soul'd working man is likely twice to submit to such treatment. We assure our readers that this, and worse; is the rule of the conduct of Charles Merton, of St. John's, Wakefield, Esquire, who, as a public officer, is we submit, fairly open to criticism, as to his public duty. And it is chien this way, to the complete failure- of the Working of the Inspectors' Act\u2014and herein,lies ~the that we attribute the fearful loss of li that South ' Viire is subject to. The chief ' risk, that of life, is run by I men; and it was to protect the men that tlke act, in. defiance of the opposition of the ployers, was passed. But by the connivance of the Derby ministry, then in. power, and by the efforts of J. C. Charlesworth, the chairman of the coal owners' associatAn, then M.P. for Wakefield, it was referred to them to appoint the inspectors. Of course they chose their instill-Incas accordingly, and in this case the employers have been most. fortunate in their selection. In Yorkshire, the act is worked to serve the employer; and the men suffer accor- dingly. Had the men their say in the appoint- ment, (and we would ask if this is not as fair an interpretation of the object of the act, as that the employers should rule the inspectors?) we submit we should bear less of \" Barns- ley Tragedies.\" Then the employers would have tobe a little nifire attentive, and perhaps a little more costly in their appliances, but it would be true policy to enforce upon them. The cost of these explosions is ruinous even to the employers. And what is the 'reason the working men have not their legitimate say, in the measures vital to their own safety? The workilig men are not, represented in the Com- morm-House of Parliament--and the masters are. Working men ponder over that fact, 'and see the censequences, even in the working of the miner's act.. How long will labour endure ' its burthens? when will it rise and assert its own rights and dignity? and put capital and inspectors in their true place, viz., as means to serve .humanity, and not to oppress and abuse? The poor miner might then have length of days, instead of the shortest life, and comfort and independence, instead of pity and contempt. But never as things are. A report of the coroner's inquest held on the Worsbro Dale tragedy has been published, and we especially direct the attention of our readers to the facts elicited. It will be seen clearly that the fault of this misfortune is not with the men. Blasting in a dangerous place is the certain cause of the explosion. Now who caused the men to blast? So far as they were concerned, the men proposed to wedge the coal; but then such is the nature of the prices paid, that they could not live by wedg.\u2022 mg.

But want of common sense, in nine cases out of ten, is the real cause of accidents, and until directors generally have learned to grasp this fact, there, is very little hope of accidents decreasing.

","487349":"COMPENSATION FOR RAILWAY A COlDENTS.\u2014Recently an Act of Parliament was printed to amend the law respecting compensation to families for railway accidents. By Lord Campbell's Act, as it is generally called, an action must be brought for a death by an accident within six months in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased. It may happen that a default occurs, or that the executor is unxvillirig to bring the action. Such action may now, however, be brought in the name of the pirties entitled to receive compensation. By the same act the jury had to appor- tion the money to be awarded, and a company could not pay an amount into court.

The proportion is increasing; the deaths by violence in 10,003 of p )pul s- don ranged from 7.16 to 7.60 in the four years 1851-51 ; from 7.95 to 8.35 in the four years 1861-67. There is no increase of death from murder, manslaughter, or suicide, but in the deaths from accident or negligence the increase is too manifest. In the five years 1863-67 2,391,165 deaths were registered in England and Wales, with the causes of death specified ; and of 83,853, the deaths of 62,708 males and 21,143 females, were violent deaths. It must also be stated that 498 of these males and 123 of the females were intoxicated when the accident or other violence which proved fatal occurred to them. 4,175 of these violent deaths were by railway accidents; 5,898 by accidents in or about mines; 28,114 by mechanical in.] urie4, such as fractures, falls' or being run over; 14,921 by chymical ' irjuries, such as burns scalds, poisoning; 23,823 by asphyxia or suspension of respiration chiefly by drowning or suffocation; 6,896 by violence not particularly de- scribed. The whole number is equal to the popula- tion of a large city, such as Norwich; 19,510 of these violent deaths, not very far from a fourth of the whole number, were deaths of children under 5 years of age; 3,933 children were burnt to death, 3,267 scalded to death, 1,950 drowned, 5,134 suffocated; so difficult is the entrance upon life' 6,696 of the violent deaths were suicides \u20141,905 males, 1791 females; 21 boys and 15 girls under 15 years old committed suicide, most of the boys by hang- ing and most of the girls by drowning\u2014one girl who drowned herself was under 5 years of age; 130 lads and 165 girls between 15 and 20 committed suicide; 252 young men and 163 young women between 20 and 25; 664 men and 272 women between 25 and 35 ; 9 l 9 men and 330 women between 35 and 45; 1,135 men and 382 women between 45 and 55; 1,066 men and 261 women between 55 and 66; 688 men and 203 women above 65. The variation with age in the ratios of the sexes will be observed: The deaths of 630 males and 633 females in the five years are returned as having occurred from murder and infanticide ; 810 whose age was under one month, 874 under one year, 921 under four years\u2014again proving the diffi- rtzlty of entrance upon life.

A new shaft is being made, which has already reached a depth of 120 yards. At half-past five o'clock, three men, Benjamin Hepworth, John Greenwood, and William Carter, descended for the pur- p.ie of blasting, &c., and on their placing a blazing fusee,. *ma lighting it, they gave the signal to ascend, which they did in the skip.

Carter managed to keep in the skip, and was drawn to the top of the shaft, but he was severely burnt on the arms and face. The banksman (George Spink) was thrown several yards from his post, but was not hurt. The barricading on the first landing was blown completely away, several planks falling into the shaft. As soon as possible after the explosion two men descended the shaft in search of their unfortunate companions, whom they found dead and shockingly mutilated.

Robert Geo. Milne, an Independent minister, formerly in charge of a con- gregation at Tintwistle, but now residing at South- port, sued the London and North-Western Railway Company for damages in consequence of a railway accident. The case was a very peauliar one. The accident took place at Copley Hill, Leeds, so far back as Oct. 16, 1867, but it was not till November, 1863, that plaintiff was permanently disabled. In the meantime he had been engaged as local secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society at a salary of \u00a33OO per year, and travelled, about the country, de- livering addresses on its behalf. On November 12, 1863, thirteen months after the accident, he had a paralytic attack which rendered him so complete a wreck that his evidence had to be taken by commis- sion. The question in dispute was -whether the paralysis resulted from the accident. The defendants contended that it was too remote from the time of the collision to have been caused by it, and the fact that the plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel about the country and deliver addresses, night after night, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible Society, was relied on in proof of this. On the other side it was maintained that from the time of the acci- dent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the final seizure, and that there was a continuity of symptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were called on each side who directly contradicted each other as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The judge, in summing up, said the plaintiff. was clearly entitled to damages for the sufferings he had under- gone since the time of the accident, but he could give no assistance as to the real point at issue.

FALL OF A RAILWAY BnrooE.\u2014An accident, which resulted in the loss of life to two men and serious injury to three others, has occurred on the Garston Railway, near the Potteries. At the bottom of Wellington Road , a bridge has been erected over the railway, extending to what is known as the Pottery Flags. A number of , men were engaged in striking the centres from under- , neath the bridge, when the arch gave way, and a mass 1 of stonework and other materials fell upon them. Two men were killed on the spot, and three others were seriously injured. The accident is attributed to the late heavy rains acting upon the stonework.

After several persons employed on the line had been examined, Mr. John Scott Russell was calledly Mr. Faithful, on behalf of the company. He stated that he considered tank engines the safest and best kind of engine that could be used for traffic on this particular line, namely, between Victoria, London-bridge, and Croydon. He had heard nothing to account for the accident, except the irregular shutting off of the steam. Colonel Yolland, who had made an inquiry by direc- tion of the Board of Trade, said that the permanent way was not strong enough to bear the weight of the engine and carriages running at such a speed. He did not think it expedient to run at the rate of sixty miles an hour with tank engines having eighteen feet six inches wheel basis, especially when the engine was not tightly screwed up to the break van behind it. The jury, after deliberating for an hour, returned the following verdict :\u2014\" That the deceased persons seve- rally came by their deaths from accident, and we, the jury, are of opinion that it was attributable to the high rate of speed at which the express trains run over the line from Croydon to Victoria. The jury would urge on the directors of the London and Brighton Company the necessity of allowing more time for the performance of the journey, and that careful attention should be given to the coupling of the trains.\" SHOCKING AND FATAL ACCIDENT.\u2014Mr. Walthew held an inquiry at the Queen's Head Tavern, High- street, Poplar, respecting the death of Joseph Fingane, aged 25, who was killed under the following shocking circumstances :\u2014Deceased was a painter, and on last Friday morning he was employed in decorating the bows of the ship East in Messrs.

It is to follow the rules of logic. Let us first take for certain that a great effect is always due to a great cause; never to a small one; in other words, an accident, apparently insignificant, never pro- duces important retilts without a pre-existing cause, which has permitted this slight accident to bring about a great effect. The spark only kindles a vast confla- gration when it falls upon combustible materials previously collected. Montesquieu thus confirms this idea: It is not fortune,' he says, 'which rules the world. . . . There are general causes, either moral or physical, which operate in every monarchy, raise it, maintain it, or overthrow it; all accidents are subject to these chases, and if the chance of a battle, that is to say, a particular cause, has ruined the State, there was a general cause which operated so that the State must p-rish by a single battle; in a word, the principal cause draws after it all the particular accidents.'* \"If during nearly 1,000 years, the Romans always issued triumphantly from the hardest trials and the greatest perils, it was because a general cause existed which made them always superior to their enemies, and did not permit defeats and partial misfortunes to entail the fall of their empire. It the Romans, after having given to the world the spectacle of a people constitu- ting itself and growing great by liberty, have seemed since Cmsar's day to fall blindly -into slavery, it is because there existed a general reason .which fatally prevented the republic from returning to the purity of its ancient institutions; it is because the new necessities and interests of a nation in travail required other means of being satisfied. As logic shows us in im- portant events the imperative necessity of their exist- ence, so we must recognise both in the long duration of an institution the proof of its excellence, and in the incontestable influence of a man upon his age the proof of his genius. \"The problem, then, is to determine ti.ihotifte..sli ,3- ment which constitut4lt\" he strength ^\" - the predominating le ' I we institution, n. ftoalorwilFunst: which the man acted. l rule, we shall avoid the errars of those aistorians who gather facts transmitted by preceding ages, without co-ordinating them according to their philosophical importance, thus glorifying that which merits blame and leaving in shadow that which requires light. It is not a minute analysis of the Roman organisation which will enable us to comprehend the duration of so great an empire, but the profound examination of the spirit of its institutions; nor is it a detailed recital of the slightest actions of a distinguished man which will reveal to us the secret of his ascendancy, but an attentive search into the elevated motives of his conduct."},"chunks":{"486218":"ACCIDENTS IN \u2022Al INEB.\u2014In the year 1863 there were 907 deaths caused by accidents in and about the coal mines of Great Britain, 226 less than in the year 1862. 163 of the deaths were caused by explosions of firk damp, 407 by falls in mines, 147 by accidents in shafts, 134 by miscellaneous underground accidents, and 56 by accidents at the surface.

SERIOUS ACCIDENT AT TH E RAILWAY BRIDGE, LE D GATE -HILL.\u2014A serious accident occurred on the morning of August 2, about half-past five o'clock, by whit h three men have sustain:A severe injuries, at the railway bridge now in -course of constraction on Ludgate hill, London. Four of the immewe girders had been raised to their inte:.,ded position, and the operations for fixing the fifth were in progr-ss on the night of August 1. The work wcnt on well till the Four Fluted, when, owing to a sudden jerk, the main chain broke, and the huge girder, weighing about 18 tons, fell to the ground, after having reached an altitude of about 8 feq. As is usual, at the time of the accident there were eight men engaged at the \"crab,\" on the south side of the hill, and in its descent the girder struck three of them, one of whom had his skull ft ightfully smashed. The poor fellows were at once convdyed to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. One of them, after being attended to, was enabled to walk -home. The other two, named-Coppock and Purser, and aged respectively 44 mad 50, are under careful tt eatment. The accident, happening at so early an hour, caused much alarm in the vicinity, the shock being described as tremendous. Much inconvenience was experenced during the morning from the entire stoppage of the traffic.","400345":")n December 10th a most melancholy accident occurred near Falstone Station, on the Border Union Railway, which resulted in the instantaneous death of the driver and stoker of the train to which the accident happened. The following are the particulars of the accident, so far as we have been able to learn :\u2014The morning through goods train from Newcastle to Edin- burgh, consisting of an engine, 22 loaded trucks, and a guard's van, was approaching Falktone, about 17 miles from Riccarton, between 11 and 12 o'clock on Saturday, at a rate of about four miles an hour, when one of the sets of wheels went on to the rails le iding to a coil siding., and the other set remained on the main line. After running for a very short distance, the eng'ne started entirely off the rails, and almost imme- diately sunk in the ground. Toe impetus of the heavy waggons behind forced the tender right on to the top of the engine, and the consequence was that Peter Young, the driver, and William Morris, the stoker,were crushed to death instantaneously. Robert Aitchison, the guard of the train, escaped unhurt. As soon as the accident took place information was telegraphed to Elexham, from which terminus an engine was immediately dispatched. When the Hexham engine reached the scene of the accident a chain was attached between it and the tender above the other engine, and the tender was dragged on to the side of the line. Then the sad results","430206":"recent begging letters was the cause of the crime. COLLISION ow THE GREENWICH LINE.\u2014On Dec 19, an accident occurred on the Greenwich line, and, like the one in Blackheath tunnel, through a failure in the signalling. The scene of this fresh accident was the junction where the Greenwich line diverges a short dis`ance from New Cross, at which spot, shortly before eight o'clock, an engine was on the up-line preparing to run on the metals of the North Sent line, when the passenger train from Greenwich came up, and a collision was the consequence. The driver and stoker of the passenger train were much injured, as were some of the passengers, and it was rumoured that one of the two men on the other engine was killed. The extent of the accident cannot, however, be learnt, for the company's servants refuse to give any information, and the public have to choose between two stories\u2014one that twenty people were seriously injured, the other that only a few persons were bruised. The driver and stoker of the passenger train were conveyed to Guy's Hospital. The cause of this accident is stated to have \u2022arisen from the signal \"All clear\" being given at the last point which the passenger train passed, and the driver was proceed- ing in perfect security through a dense fog which then prevailed until the very moment when the train came into collision with the engine. The traffic was resumed soon after the accident.

By Lord Campbell's Act, as it is generally called, an action must be brought for a death by an accident within six months in the name of the executor or administrator of the deceased. It may happen that a default occurs, or that the executor is unxvillirig to bring the action. Such action may now, however, be brought in the name of the pirties entitled to receive compensation. By the same act the jury had to appor- tion the money to be awarded, and a company could not pay an amount into court. It is now provided that one sum in the matter be sufficient to be paid into court, and if the jury consider the same sufficient, then the verdict on the issue to be for the defendants. The alte- rations now made are of an important character in railway and other accidents.

He wore the boat about till she came round on the starboard tack, when the wind took her on the starboard quarter, and she went down instantly. He could not account for the boat going over in any way. By the Jury: She was keel uppermost before he told the cadets to cling to her; finding there was no other chance he called out to the cadets in the water, \"Strike out for the boat,\" and he believed they all did so. There were not too many lads in the boat; hstd there been a few more the accident might not have happened, as thep would have acted as ballast. He did not approve of taking ballast in the boat. Now that the accident bn taken place, he thought it would be better that the keel of the boat should be a little deepened. He had always considered her a very safe boat.

Ac.idents on a great scale do not ex- cite so much sensation in America as in England, owing to the area of the country, the varieties of risk, and greater recklessness of temperament. With thousands on thousands of miles of river navigation, in wild, half-deserted territory, careful inspection or care- ful msnagement is impossible; elaborate precautions would be costly, if not impossible; people, therefore, make up their minds to accidents. Much the same may be said of railrcads. The alternative has been a great number of cheaply and hastily constructed roads, worked at low fares, or a very few expensive and care- fully Managed lines for short distances. People chose the former, and when casualties come bear them as soldiers bear the losses of a victory. With mining accidents the people are less familiar, no mines reach the depth of the English mines; but there is no Govern- ment inspection, and no legally enforced precautions are taken. The late accident occurred in a mine with but one shaft, and round the mouth of the shaft there was a large pile of wcoden buildings, containing stores, hoisting machinery, and so on, dry as tinder under the lo::g drought. It caught fire, and the fire communica- ted with the mine; and, there being no other outlet, even for ventilation, the men were crowded into one corner, and miserably perished.","461077":"the prisoner was committed for trial for embezzlement.

It seems that William Todd, aged 26, his brother Enfield Todd, aged about 20, and another bea,chmart, mimed Samuel E. Fleming, 20, proceeded out of the harbour in a new boat, tor \"the purpose of drawing for some smelts and other fish along the shore. Just as they reached tho bar, and precisely where the late life boat catastrophe took place, their small omit was caught by a sea and swamped. The men were thrown into the water, and being heavily attired, two of them sank and were drowmed ; while Enfield Todd manit,ged to extricate himself, and swam to the beach. The accident was observed from the north pier by some pilots, and they at once launched a boat and proceeded to the scene of the disaster, but too late to be of service. Subsequently the boat was picked up, and the body of the elder Todd was found entangled in the netting. The tide was low on the bar at the time ot the accident. Twenty-five beaehmen have been drowned in Yarmouth river since January last.","265770":"In one notion\u2014the only one\u2014ag Einst the North- London Beltway, the verdict was in revour of the com- pany, it appearing that the accident arose from the pas- senger having alighted from the train while it was in I motion. Here there was no contributory negligenee (as. 1 is not unfrequently alleged in some cases of this kind) on the part at the company's servants. The acc'dent, it appeared, arose entirely from the passenger's own rashness. Against the London and 13.ighton Company there was but one action' which was brought by the widow of a labourer who had been killed on the line. A verdict, in that case was given against thc company for \u00a3l5O. The London, Chatham, and Dover Company also had but one action against them brought to trial.

There are also safety chains, one on each side of the main coupling. The improvement comes into action the moment the engine or tender happens to diverge at a certain angle from the line of railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of gear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are driven back by the springs into the void left by the draw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are instantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame of the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com- pletely separated from thereat of the train.

Hills, the coroner for Chatham, has concluded an investigation into the circumstances connected with the recent shocking accident which occurred in the foundry at Chatham Dockyard, by which Charles Crossland, one of the workmen, lost his life in a most horrible manner. From the evidence of the witnesses examined it appeared that at the time of the accident the workmen, between 30 and 40 in number,, were engaged casting the large brass cleaver, weighing seven tons, to be placed in front of the stem of the Lord Warden ironclad frigate. The whole of the molten metal had been run into the mould, when the sides suddenly gave way, scattering the liquid metal in all directions. The deceased, who was standing in an elevated place, jumped down and attempted to run away, when a large quantity of the hot metal fell in a shower on him, inflicting most horrible injuries, of which, after lingering. about 24 hours, he died. The coroner and jury instituted a searching investigation into the character and strength of the mould, when all the witnesses were unanimous in expressing their opinion that it was constructed of extra strength, and with all possible care, and that the accident was, in fact, inexplicable. It was also stated that it would occupy about six weeks to construct","400564":"persons and injury to 161 persons, making together in the course of 3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running off the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63 persons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons, besides involving destruction of rolling stock and large surna for compensation. This indicates to some extent the advantage of adopting the system of coupling patented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia- ment-street, and which appears to be very complete in every respect for the purpose intended. It is in course of being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains en the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from that cause have heretofore been rather more frequent than on other railways A full-sized model of the apparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament- street, which will enable those who are interested in preventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It is rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of railways have no power to require the adoption of any improvement that might appear to them calculatedito prevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although they have power to prevent the opening of a railway for traffic until all the requirements as to the stability of the works and the efficiency of the signals have been fully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the railway department of the Board of Trade.","637501":"the Manches- )dge paid regularly ?\u2014No, they owed at one -about \u00a397 to the general fund, but they were 3d forward in the .report as if they did sot owe ing. at I suppose arose from the fact that the men were members of the society in Manchester at time were out of emploYment F\u2014No, it was &Ise they were using the money for the strike ad of paying the contributions to the Qxecutive 5.61, and that executive council being members e Manchester lodge kept them straight with the 1, so that if there were any accidents or deaths, , , wovld be entitled to the benefits.

The defendants contended that it was too remote from the time of the collision to have been caused by it, and the fact that the plaintiff had been able after the accident to travel about the country and deliver addresses, night after night, in favour of the British and Foreign Bible Society, was relied on in proof of this. On the other side it was maintained that from the time of the acci- dent the plaintiff gradually became worse, until the final seizure, and that there was a continuity of symptoms throughout. Eminent medical men were called on each side who directly contradicted each other as to paralysis resulting from the accident. The judge, in summing up, said the plaintiff. was clearly entitled to damages for the sufferings he had under- gone since the time of the accident, but he could give no assistance as to the real point at issue.

The last down train left the Truro station at half past seven o'clock, and on arriving at the Penwither's Via- duct came into collision with a low truck, the engine ran off the line, and was precipitated over the bridge. The carriages were luckily disconnected, and did not follow. The passengers, therefore, were for the most part unhurt, and none of them have sustained injury more serious than a severe shaking. The driver was killed on the spot, and the breaksman and fireman were injured. FALL OF A RAILWAY BnrooE.\u2014An accident, which resulted in the loss of life to two men and serious injury to three others, has occurred on the Garston Railway, near the Potteries. At the bottom of Wellington Road , a bridge has been erected over the railway, extending to what is known as the Pottery Flags. A number of , men were engaged in striking the centres from under- , neath the bridge, when the arch gave way, and a mass 1 of stonework and other materials fell upon them. Two men were killed on the spot, and three others were seriously injured. The accident is attributed to the late heavy rains acting upon the stonework.

After several persons employed on the line had been examined, Mr. John Scott Russell was calledly Mr. Faithful, on behalf of the company. He stated that he considered tank engines the safest and best kind of engine that could be used for traffic on this particular line, namely, between Victoria, London-bridge, and Croydon. He had heard nothing to account for the accident, except the irregular shutting off of the steam. Colonel Yolland, who had made an inquiry by direc- tion of the Board of Trade, said that the permanent way was not strong enough to bear the weight of the engine and carriages running at such a speed. He did not think it expedient to run at the rate of sixty miles an hour with tank engines having eighteen feet six inches wheel basis, especially when the engine was not tightly screwed up to the break van behind it. The jury, after deliberating for an hour, returned the following verdict :\u2014\" That the deceased persons seve- rally came by their deaths from accident, and we, the jury, are of opinion that it was attributable to the high rate of speed at which the express trains run over the line from Croydon to Victoria.

It is to follow the rules of logic. Let us first take for certain that a great effect is always due to a great cause; never to a small one; in other words, an accident, apparently insignificant, never pro- duces important retilts without a pre-existing cause, which has permitted this slight accident to bring about a great effect. The spark only kindles a vast confla- gration when it falls upon combustible materials previously collected. Montesquieu thus confirms this idea: It is not fortune,' he says, 'which rules the world. . . . There are general causes, either moral or physical, which operate in every monarchy, raise it, maintain it, or overthrow it; all accidents are subject to these chases, and if the chance of a battle, that is to say, a particular cause, has ruined the State, there was a general cause which operated so that the State must p-rish by a single battle; in a word, the principal cause draws after it all the particular accidents.'* \"If during nearly 1,000 years, the Romans always issued triumphantly from the hardest trials and the greatest perils, it was because a general cause existed which made them always superior to their enemies, and did not permit defeats and partial misfortunes to entail the fall of their empire.

Accidents on a great scale do not excite so much sensation in America as in England, owing to the area of the country, the varieties of risk, and greater recklessness of temperament. With thousands of miles of river navigation, in wild, half-deserted territory, careful inspection or careful management is impossible; elaborate precautions would be costly, if not impossible; people, therefore, make up their minds to accidents. Much the same may be said of railroads. The alternative has been a great number of cheaply and hastily constructed roads, worked at low fares, or a very few expensive and carefully managed lines for short distances. People chose the former, and when casualties come they bear them as soldiers bear the losses of a victory. With mining accidents the people are less familiar, no mines reach the depth of the English mines; but there is no government inspection, and no legally enforced precautions are taken. The late accident occurred in a mine with but one shaft, and round the mouth of the shaft there was a large pile of wooden buildings, containing stores, hoisting machinery, and so on, dry as tinder under the long drought.

In 1861 the lives lost by accidents in coal mines were only 943, but the year 1862 saw several accidents of unusual fatality. 47 persons were killed by an explosion at Cethin Colliery, near Merthyr; 59 persons by another at Edmund's Main Colliery, near Barnsley; and, most terrible of all, 209 persons at Hartley Colliery. This last calamity will long be remembered, if only for the extraordinary sympathy excited throughout the kingdom, resulting in contributions for the families of the sufferers to an amount exceeding \u00a320,000,\u2014a sum which proved, in fact, far larger than the reasonable requirements of the case, so that an arrangement had to be made for varying the application of the surplus.\n\nNote: I removed the text about indigo imports as it is not related to accidents.","135482":"\"thirteen months after the accident, he had a paralytic attack which rendered him so complete a wreck that his evidence had to be taken by commission.

People chose the former, and when casualties come they bear them as soldiers bear the losses of a victory.
