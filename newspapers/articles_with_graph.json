Sir F. R.\nSandford presided, and after expressing hie pleasure at\nthe large attendance at the confeience stated,. on behalf\nof the committee, the warm interest they felt in the\nphysical education of the members of institutions- in\nunion with the association. He would requeet Mr. IL\nH. Sales, their secretary, to introduce the subjects for\ndiscussion. Mr. Sales, stiter having descrileelthe origin\nof the annual fete in 1864, and the great success that\nattended it,. and also that of last yi ar, noticed in detail\nthe arrangements hitherto made and the alterations\npreposed. lin the sports, it was suggested i a wider\ndistinction between urban and suburban societies\nshould be made, so ae- to put competitors on a\nmore equal footing. The judges h?cl hitherto been\nprofessional men, but it had been thought advisable to\nretain the services of military men. In cons euence of\nthe small number of entries for the band contest, he\nsuggested its discontinuance. At the flmstfte, an open-\nair concert of 800 voices was given, but the result was\nso unsatisfactory that it was not renewed. This year\nan in-door concert on a large scale was propo-ed. The\n, other details of the fife, such as the balloon ascent,\nentertainments by professional gymnasts (under the\ndirection of Mr. Nelson Lee), diAribution of prizes,\nand other matters, would not need discussion, Captain\nMacgregor did not approve of military judges,\nas equally efficient men could be obtained\nfrom the ranks of the volunteers. He- strongly\nurged the encouragement of those spoits that did\nnot require much spice, HO that mernb rs need\nnot go from their institutions to practice. A rowing\nmatch, be considerel, would not only be attractive but\nprofitable. The delegate from the Duck-lane Club said\nthat although he was charged to make sundry objec-\ntions, he Was first instructed to express the-great satis-\nfaction of his club at the way in which the affairs of\npreceding fetee had been managed by the officers of the\nassociation. He urged most strongly a more equitable\ncompetition in the sports, so that the old men might\nhave a chance. He was turned fifty, and could not\nrun a mile race,, but he challenged any other man\nnot younger to- a 300 yards' spin, and hoped there\nwould be something this year for men between\nfifty and ninety. The delegate from Greville\nHouse lustitution suegested larger- prizes in\nsome events. The delegate from the West London\nYouths' Institute holed that silver medals and cups\nwould be substituted for mon,py prizes. Illtimately, on\nthe mot on of the.delegate-froAn the London Mechanics'\nInstitution, secondmit by the delegate from the Stor-\nmont House Club, it was resolved to appoint a sports\ncommittee, to consist of a delegate from each institu-\ntion. At the conclusion of the conference a selection\nof glees and part songs were sung by a choir consisting\nof members of various societies, under the able direction\nof the Rev. G. B. Macilwiin. Sir F. R. S tndford\nthanked the conductor and choir, eseecielly Mr. Heller,\nwho had so carefully trained the greatest number, for\ntheir efficient and pleasing services;, and on the motion\nof the Rev. C._ Jacob a cordial vote of thanks was given\nI to the chairman.\n\nFATAL BOAT ACCIDENT.\u2014GREAX YARMOUTH, Tues-\nday.\u2014A sad accident occurred at Gorlesxn yesterday\nafternoon, resulting in the loss of two beachmen,\nand the natrow escape of a third. It seems that\nWilliam Todd, aged 26, his brother Enfield Todd,\naged about 20, and another bea,chmart, mimed Samuel\nE. Fleming, 20, proceeded out of the harbour in a\nnew boat, tor \"the purpose of drawing for some smelts\nand other fish along the shore. Just as they reached tho\nbar, and precisely where the late life boat catastrophe\ntook place, their small omit was caught by a sea and\nswamped. The men were thrown into the water, and\nbeing heavily attired, two of them sank and were\ndrowmed ; while Enfield Todd manit,ged to extricate\nhimself, and swam to the beach. The accident was\nobserved from the north pier by some pilots, and they\nat once launched a boat and proceeded to the scene of\nthe disaster, but too late to be of service. Subsequently\nthe boat was picked up, and the body of the elder Todd\nwas found entangled in the netting. The tide was low\non the bar at the time ot the accident. Twenty-five\nbeaehmen have been drowned in Yarmouth river since\nJanuary last.\n\nRAILWAY COMPBNSATION UASE.\u2014A compensation case\nwas heard on Friday before Mr. Humphreys, the\ncoroner, and a special jury, \"Johnson v. the Metro-\npolitan District Railway,\" at the Sheriff's Court, Red\nLion square.

Thu pson was brought from Kirkdale about\nhalf-past 10, and he was conveyed from the railway\nstation to the Court House in a cab. The street in\nfront of the hall was completely\ncrowd, assembled apparently in order to catch a glimpse\nof the prisoner; and, as soon as the doors were opened,\nthe court was crowdt,d in every part.

No particulars\nhave transpired beyond the fact that his death and\nburial have taken place within the last few days.

The ordinary coupling consists\nof draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws'\nso as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train\nclose together. There are also safety chains, one on\neach side of the main coupling. The improvement\ncomes into action the moment the engine or tender\nhappens to diverge at a certain angle from the line\nof railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of\ngear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are\ndriven back by the springs into the void left by the\ndraw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are\ninstantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame\nof the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com-\npletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears\nthat accidents from engines running off the rails amount\nto more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci-\ndents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the\nIst of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from\nthis cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas-\nsengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861\nthere were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas-\nsengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862\nthere were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and\n282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci-\ndents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail-\nway, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and\ninjury to 161 persons, making together in the course of\n3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running\noff the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63\npersons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons,\nbesides involving destruction of rolling stock and large\nsurna for compensation. This indicates to some extent\nthe advantage of adopting the system of coupling\npatented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia-\nment-street, and which appears to be very complete in\nevery respect for the purpose intended. It is in course\nof being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains\nen the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from\nthat cause have heretofore been rather more frequent\nthan on other railways A full-sized model of the\napparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament-\nstreet, which will enable those who are interested in\npreventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It\nis rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of\nrailways have no power to require the adoption of any\nimprovement that might appear to them calculatedito\nprevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although\nthey have power to prevent the opening of a railway\nfor traffic until all the requirements as to the stability\nof the works and the efficiency of the signals have been\nfully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the\nrailway department of the Board of Trade.\n\nANOTHER DANGEROUS FREAK OF A SAILOR.\u2014On the\nmorning of December 10, about four o'clock, as the mail\ntrain going north was, passing through Broughton, on\nthe Lancaster and Preston Railway., about a mile south\nof the Broughton and Barton Station, a sailor, a pas-\nal\nfull\nreipea geeds. , stepped out\nIle fell on\nos efn\nthe\ner i\ntrainu on one\nso of thew asee cgoingon dt\nclasse carriages,\nthe line, but fortunately received no further injuries\nthan slight bruises on one shoulder and, one knee. There\nwere three other sailors in the same compartment, and\nall of them having been partaking rather too freely of\ngrog, they had been fast asleep.. One of them awaken-\ning, being under the impression that he was at his\njourney's end, got up with the intention of alighting,\nand stepped out, but was surprised on finding himself\ncast to the ground with much force. On recovering\nfrom the shock of his fall, he saw the signal light off\nthe station at Barton ahead, and made his way thither,\nand related to the astonished station master his adven-\nture. He remained at the station about fourhours, until\nthe arrival of the next train which stopped there when\nhe was sent onwards. Except that no startling there,\nof\na Muller-like catastrophe followed the discovery of the\nsailor having fallen from the carriage, the incident is\nsomething like one which occurred on the London and\nNorth Western Railway, a few days ago, when a drunken\n' sailor fell out of the train when at full speed, and his\ncompanions were apprenended on the charge of murder,\nand were only released on their companion appearing in\npropria persona, and unhurt, to tell the Pile\u00b0 he had\nnot been murdered.\nTHE PEACE ADDRESS TO THE -UNITED STATBS.\nWashington dispatch says :\u2014About six weeks ago, Mr.\nJoseph Parker, of Manchester, England, arrived at\nNew York, bringing with him the peace address of the\nsubjects of Great Britain and Ireland, with a letter\nfrom Sir Henry de lloughton to Governor Seymour,\nwho declined formally to receive it, ;\nase.gning as a\nreason that it should be given to the President of the\nUnited States, the latter being the only authorised\nchannel of communication between other nations and\nthe citizens of the United States. Mr. Parker, having\narrived here last week, addressed a note to Secretary\nSeward, stating that he had been deputed to this coun-\ntry to convey the address to the people of the United\nStates, and asking the honour of an oPPertunity of\npresenting it to the President. To this the secretary\nreplied that, before answering the letter, it was desir-\nable to be further informed whether Mr. Parker had\nany authority from the Government of Great Britain\nand Ireland for the purpose referred to, and whether\nhis mission had been made known to the diplomatic\nagent of that government near the e\nbevernment of\nthe United States. Mr. Parker replied bY saying that\nthe address he had the honour of bringing to this\ncountry, containing the signatures. of 350,000 of his\ncountrymen, from the peer to the artisan, was not from\nthe Government of Great Britain, nor from any political\nparty. It was simply an expression of the earnest\ndesire of Great Britain to see Peace restored to this\ncountry. The correspondence closed by a note from\nthe Secretary of State, in which he said the Govern-\nment of the United States could not receive the\naddress, and that the request for an interview with the\nPresident was, therefore, declined. The intention now\nis to present the address to Congress at the approaching\nsession. \u2022\nMATTHEWS AND THE REWARD.\u2014.There is RO truth\nin the watement that Matthews has received the\nreward offered for the conviction of Muller. The\nrailway company and the bank have handed over their\nrespective sums to Sir Richard Mayne, and when\nGovernment have added their portiun, the question of\nhow the money should be divided will then come under\nconsideration. It is said, however, that it will be\nequally divided between Mr. Death; Matthews, and the\ntwo Repsches. Inspector Tanner will not, as is gene-\nrally supposed, Come in for any portion of the reward.\nIn fact, beyond his salary, there is no recognition of the\nservices rendered by this intelligent officer, and unless\nthe public think proper to accord him some mark of\ntheir approbation he will go unrewarded. \u2022\n\nBREACH OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE.\nIn the Court of C..ommen- Pleason December 10, an\naction\u2014Wylie v. Baser was brought to recover\ndamages for breach of promis- of marriage. The de-\nfendant, by his plead', gs, denied the promise, anal\nalsl alleged that a roast) ,able time for the ,performanoe\nof the promise had not been a lowed.\nMr. Gitiard and Mr. rll.l,,chlan were for the plaintiff;\nMr. Phil brick for the defendant,\nMr. G.ffard said he oelieved he could fully establish\nboth the promise, and the refusal to perform it, and that\nthe only question for the jury would be the amount of\ndamages. The plaintiff, Mrs. Elizabeth Mary Wylie,\nwas a widow. The oefendant was a grocer at South\nNorwood. The plaintiff had for some time been employed\nas a housekeeper; and it was through the defendant\nbeing in want of a houskeeper that he first met Mrs.\nWylie. He was gre aly taken with her. They\nbecame intimate, and at length the defendant engaged\nto marry the plaintiff on Cioydan :Fair day. The\ndefendant was a widower, between 50 and 60 years of\nage, with a grown up family, and after having engaged\nhimself to the plaintiff he introduced her to his family,\nand afterwards gave her to understand that they were\ngreatly p'eased with her. The letters which he had\nwritten to her would clearly show the relation in which\nthey stood. The learned gentleman then read the\nfollowing letters addressed by the defendant to the\nplaintiff:\u2014\n\n\"5, Porthurl road, South Norwood,\nAugust 10, 1864.\n\"My dearest Mrs. W,\u2014l arrived home quite safe\nabout eleven o'clock last evening. lam very pleased\nto say that I feel all the better for my trip, but did not\nlike parting with you, and watched you as far as I\ncould see you, but could not get you to look back after\npoor me. I hope you got home all right, and are quite\nwell. lam very plea-ed Ir. Kemp was with us, as he\nseems very much made up with you. .He kept saying\nlast night, 'I can't ihink where you looked her up,'\nand was very anxious for me to tell him, but I thought\nthat could not coneern him very much. I shall soon\nhear what he reports at home. He so regrets that his\nwife was not with him. I wish she had. I hope it\nwill not be long before Fre all meet, and pleasantly. I\nhope. I told him it was all arranged\u2014we were going\nto be married after a eertain time had elapsed; and he\nthinks I am quite right in pleasing myself, which he\nknows I shall do. I only wish, my dear, it was coming\noff next week, as the time seems so very long. I am,\nmy dearest of all, yours ever faithfully,\n\"\\V.

I was very\nsorry you caught cold, but hope it will not be serious.\nI have been very poorly since Tuesday, but am much\nbetter this morning. I hope ta see you on Wednesday,\nand not be so sadly disappointed again; but you will\nwrite again, for one of your letters does me more good\n,than all the medicine.\u2014l am, my dearest Lizzie, yours\never truly,\n\n\"W.

I do so wish I was\ngoing to be with you; I think that would cure me\nquite. Now, my dear, I cannot tell you what an\nimpression Mr. Kemp has made on my family; they\nare all so anxious to see you. He tells all my friends\nwhat a nice little body I have found, but he ,still\nwonders where I found you. I got censured for leaving\nyou that unlucky Tuesday as I did, and wanted to know\nhow I could behave so rude to, you: So, after all this,\nI shall be so happy to introduce you to my daughter;\nbut shasays shetwould rather see you first at her house,\nwhich I shall arrange. Ycu will,, my dear, quite\nunderstand how necessary; perhaps if she met you at\nmy house first, it would be too much for her. I was in\nLondon when your letter arrived this morning. When\nI returned my sister laughed, and said she had got\nsomething nice for breakfast, and gave-me your letter.\u2014\nI remain, dearest little angel, yours ever faithfully,\"\n\" W._BAKER.\"\n\"Aug. 22, 1864.\n\n\"My dearest little Pet,\u2014Tour dear letter came safe to\nhand this morning quite expected. lam so pleased you\nare coming to town so soon I am so\npleased to tell you my health keeps improving, but I\ncannot keep warm at nights. (Laughter.) My whole\nthought is about you. I regret that you are kept away\nfrom me. I shall have no more comfort until we are\nunited, which I hope will be soon.

Do let me meet you at the\nstation when you arrive in London, as you I am\nso anxious to see you. I don't think it possible for me\nto wait the time which I named to you before we are\nunited, for the more I think of you the more I love you,\nsincerely hoping it is the same with you. I am so\npleased to tell you I find myself improving every day\nand, hoping you are quite well, I am, my darling pet,\nyours ever most affectionately, W.

After I\nleft you last evening, reflecting on our arrangements,\nwas very sorry to find the time we appointed was\nCroydon Fair week. I never gave it a thought till\nafter we parted. You will come by the train which\nleaves Victoria at 12.12, and I will meet you.--I am,\nmy dearest little pet, your own most affectionate\n\"W.\nIn a subsequent letter, Mr. Giffard continued, the de-\nfendant advised the plaintiff to go to Newington Church,\nand then she heard the banns proclaimed between\nherself and the defendant. In another letter he said,\n\"I do not think it is possible for me to wait until the\nfair. lam so cold at nights that you must come and\nkeep me warm.\" (Laughter.) It would be unnecesSary\nto read more letters. He (Mr. Giflard) would show\nthat the defendant refused to perform the promise so dis-\ntinctly established by the correspondeace. The defen-\ndant had a good business, and would be able to pay\nsubstantial damages. The lady being'3B, it might be\nthought her feelings were less acute than those of a\nyoung maiden; but it may be considered that this was\npossibly her last chance. (Laughter.)\nMr. Greenwood, the plaintiff's attorney, was called,\nand stated that after his first letter on the subject of the\npromise the defendant called on him and said he could\nnot perform his promise, as his children thought the\nplaintiff too young for him. He would pay the expense\nof cheap lodgings for Mrs. Wylie until she got a situ-\nation. He wished to see the plaintiff privately, but\nhe (the witness) would only agree to this on condition\nthat the meeting took place at his own office. In his\nre-examination, he stated that his reason for this was\nthat the plaintiff had told him the defendant had be-\nhaved improperly to her when they were alone.\nMr. Philbrick then addressed the jury for the defend-\nant, and said that he should be able to satisfy them\nthat the plaintiff had conseeted to the marriage not\n\u2022 taking place until a later period than stated, and that\nthis action was brought too soon, as a reasonable time\nfor the marriage had not arrived when the action was\ncommenced.\nTwo witnesses were called, a tailor and his wife, of\nwhom the defendant had ordered the clothes he intended\nto be married in; but their evidence,: taken at the utmost\nvalue for the defendant, only fixed the event for some\nday subsequent to the 22nd of October, when t3ix months\nfrom the defendant's first wife's death would have\nelapse 4.\nThe Lord Chief Justice summed up the case very\ncarefully to the jury, and pointed out to them the offer\nof the defendant to ' pay for cheap lodgings for the\nplaintiff until she could get a situation\u2014\" a very\nwithering change for one who expected to be his\nwife.\"\nThe jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014\nDamages, \u00a32OO.\n\nTHE KING OF PRUSSIA AND !lIS ARMY.\u2014The King\nof Prussia has issued the following order of the day to\nthe army The glorious war against Denmark is\nended.

J. Woods, coroner for the western division of\nSurrey, at the Percy Arms Inn. The room in which\nthe inquiry was conducted, and which was situate atout\na quarter of a mile from the powder mills, was a long\napartment, furnished with numerous windows, all of\nwhich had been demolished by the explosion. The\nCoroner said that in this inquiry it would be neces-\nsary to ascertain not merely the cluse of death, but\nalso whether the machinery employed at the powder\nmills was proper for the particular manufacture,\nand, whether due precautions were taken for the\nprevention of accidents: His pra sent intention was\nmerely to open the inqulry and then adjourn it. After\nthe jury had seen the bodies and the scene of the ex-\nplosion, the following evidence was taken :\u2014Jare e 3\nWilliam Upfold, foreman of Mr. Share's gi,nnowder\nworks, said he last saw the deceased alive about 10\nminutes past 11 o'clock on Friday morn:ng, when tiny\nwere both standing at the door of the press-house\npress-house frem 7 o'clock on Friday morning, raid\ntalking to him. They had both been engag, din the\nwitness had had no occasion to visit the building in his\nCapacity of foreman. It was his duty to inspect the\nworkmen on the premises, and he usually went round\nbetween 7 and 8 o'clock for that purpose. The hour\nfor the commencement of work was 7 o'clock, and there\nwas no general inspection of the men prior to the'r\ncommencing, wither were there any written or printed\nrules for the regulation of the establishment. The men\nwere compelled to change their ordinary dress and to\nput on a dress specially adapted for working in the\nmills before any of them were allowed to enter\nany portion of the works, and a small building cal!ed\nthe \"wash-up house\" was used for the purpose.\nThere was no person, however, employed to see that\nthis regulation was carried out at the moment the men\nentered the premises. After leaving the men the wit-\nness proceeded to his own house, about a quarter of a\nmile distant, and had just got inside when the explosion\ntook place. This caused him to return immediately.\nwhen he found that the press-house had expleded and\nthe two men had disappeared. He immediately set a\nparty of men to work, and the body of Farnfield was\nsoon discovered, lying about 200 yards up the meadow,\nand that of Man Fell in a ditch about 80 yards below the\npress-house. Farnfield's body was much shattered, and\nboth arms were off. There was not a particle of clothing\nupon the bodies. If the men had changed their ordinary\nclothing, it would have been lett in the \" wash-up\nhouse,' but this had been destroyed by the explosion,\nand all the clothing it contained, one shoe, which be-\nlonged to Farnfield, bad since been found. Mansell\nhad been employed upon the works for the past two\nyears, and Farnfield almost from his infancy. The\nmachinery in the press-room was new except the by-\ndraulic press, which had been in work about seven ye irs.\nWhen the witness EitNY the deceased at the door of the\npress-house both bad on their working dress. At this\nstage of the proceedings the inquiry was adjourned, and\nit was resolved that in the meantime the Board of Trade\nAhould be requested to send a competent person imme_\ndiately to inspect the scene of the accident.\n\nOUR MINERAL WEALTH.\u2014 1 hrough the courtesy of\nour esteemed correspondent, Mr. Robert Hunt, F,R.S.,\nthe Keeper of Mining Records at the Royal School of\nMines, we have been favoured with the statistics of our\nmineral production for 1863, which will be issued to\nthe public in a week or ten days from this time. The\nvalue of the minerals produced was \u00a329,151,976, from\nwhich metals of the value of \u00a336,364,327 were extracted.\nOf gold quartz we produced 385 tons, worth \u00a31,500; of\ntin ore, 15,157 tons, worth \u00a3963,985; of copper ore,\n212,947 tons, worth t,100,554; of lead ore, 91,283\ntons, worth \u00a31,193,530 ; of silver ore, 38 ton., worth\n\u00a35,703; and of zinc ore, 1,941 tons, worth \u00a329,968.\nDuring the year in question there were sold 95,376\ntons of pyrites, for \u00a362,035; and the rarer mimnils\u2014\nwolfram, uranium, gossans,\nof\nn.c, and earthy minera's\nraised were of the value ot \u00a31,980,866. Th se items, i\nwith the value of 9,101,552 tons of ron ore, \u00a33,240,890,\nand 86,292 215 tons of coal, \u00a320,572,945, raises the\ntotal to \u00a329,151,976, which was manufactured into\nnearly \u00a340,000,000 of merchantable produce. To pro-\nduce these results direct employment has been given to\nat least 500,000 men, so that our mineral industries may\nbe considered as alone supportipg a population of nearly\n3,000,000, in addition to adding !much to the general\nwealth of the kingdom, and especially to the wealth of\nthose whose capital has been employed in mining ope-\nrations.\u2014Afinirq Journal.\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO A CHILD AT A RAILWAY STA-\nTION.--A frightful accident has occurred to Frederick\nPacker, a boy 11 years of age, at the New-cross station\nof the Brighton Railway. It\n\u201eappears that the deceased'\nwhose parents reside at Depdord, had alighted from a\ncarriage with his mother, and that in passing along\nthe platform he stepped on his mother's dress, which\nhad the effect of throwing him across the lino of metals.\nThe train at this instant was leaving the station, and\nbefore it could be stopped both the unfortunate child's\nlegs were severed by carriages passing over them.\nWhen picked up part of tho bowels were protruding.\nThe sufferer was conveyed to Guy's Hospital, where\ndeath ensued shortly afterwards,\nDESTRUCTIVE FIRE OF FARMING STOCK \u2014A disastrous\nfire broke out on the premises of Mr. Pitcher, the Nun-\nnery Farm, about two miles from Worcester, on the 6th\nof August. Some men were engaged in making a rick\nof barley, when they observed smoke issue from a barn\nat the end of the rickyard. Before they could reach the\nbarn the flames burst out, and extended to the iiclryard,\nsetting fire to the half-made barley rick and all the other\nricks in the yard. Three file engines were quickly on\nthe spot; but, as it was evident no efforts could ex -\ni\ntinguish the fire n the ricks and barns, their energies\nwere confined to the saving of the house. The garden\nhedge was already on fire, and the fruit on the trees\nagainst the house shrivelled up with the heat, when\nprovidentially the wind changed and blew the flames\nin another direction, or the house must have fallen a\nprey to them. As it was, the fire was confined to the\nbarn and rickyard. The fire is conjectured to have\narisen from some men employed at work smoking on\nthe premises, but nothing certain is known. Mr.\nPitcher is fully insured. Only two nights previously\nthere was another fire at an adjoining farm not half a\nmile off, when a large rick of hay worth over \u00a32OO wls\nestroy ed.\n\nRAILWAYS OF ENGLAND AND\nWALES.\n\nThe annual return from the Board of Trade concern-\ning the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued.\nIt exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase\nfor 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be\nin mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several\nitems of income and expenditure. The statistics are\ngigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to\nillustrate with important truthfulness the immense\nresults which are identified with the railway system\nof this country, and how these results spring from the\nnecessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485\npassengers travelled on the railways in England\nand Wales, which, taking the population at\nsomething under 22,000,000 would give an aver-\nage of say eight journeys for each individual.\nFrom these returns we cull the following statistics\nof the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of\nDecember, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way\nopen, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying\n173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those\nwho held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991.\nIn connection with the passengers, there were carried\nat the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and\n327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following\ngreat reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of\ncoal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of\ngeneral merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833\ncattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also\ncarried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081\nmiles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains\nwas 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the\npassenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods\ntraffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all\nsources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822.\nIt is an important point to consider how this wonder-\nful system of traffic has been performed in respect of\nthe s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the\nrecurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the\nactual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to\nestimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met\nwith accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger\ntrains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were\nkilled and 371 injured. The total number of passen-\ngers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to\ntrains during 1863 on all railways in England and\nWales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129\npeople kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on\nrailways, including trespassers and people killed or\ninjured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa-\ntion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the\ngeneral statistics, which may be divided into a more\nparticular form. On the London and North-Western\n19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season-\nticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen-\ngers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as\ncompensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts\nfrom pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods\ntraffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi-\nture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts\n\u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221\npassengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets.\nThere were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his\nown m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be-\nyond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as\ncompensation for personal injuries. The receipts were:\nFrom passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196.\nThe proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per\ncent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were\n11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four\naccidents took place, by which 7 passengers were\nkilled and 33 received injuries, which cost the company\n\u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re-\nceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods;\nthe working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net\nincome \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515\npassengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1\nassenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age\nfor working on this line was 50, and the total gross\nincome \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These\nreturns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan\nI:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to\nillustrate the working of the purely provincial under-\ntakings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried\nduring 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from\nwhom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the\ngoods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross\nincome of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of\nexpenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits\n\u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21\npassengers were injured, but none fatally.

For some time past\nthe animal has been suffeting from disease in the tee,\nwhich necessitated the cutting of its claws. In order\nto do this without danger, a large box was prepared\nwith a grated bottom, covered by a wcoden floor, which\ncould be withdrawn so as to allow the lion's feet to pass\nbetween the b rre. The top of the box was also made to\ndescend by means of screws so as to press on the\nanimal and prevent it from drawing in its feet. Wheu\nthe lion had entered the box, the latter was turned on\nits side and the sliding bottom w;thdrawn. The paws\nthen slipped between the bars and the screws above\nwere tightened. M. Thiernasse, assisted by five pupils\nof the Vwerinary School, then proceeded to cut away\nthe claws. The patient bore the op-ration tolerably\nwell, only uttering a short roar occasionaliy, and seemed\nrelieved when the first paw had been cut and dressed.\nA keeper, to whom the lion is much attached, sat near\nits head and endeavoured to calm it by talking, evidently\nnot without effect. The operation Was successfully\nperformed, and there is every reason to believe that the\n, cure will be complete.\nSINGULAR DEATH OF A LITTLE BOY.\u2014 Last week\nMr. Taylor held an inquest on the body of a child three\nyears old, the son of Mr. Joshua Rawlin, farme:r Tan-\nkersley, who met his death very singularly. It seemed\nfrom the evidence that the chilu's mother had just been\nconfined, but not progressing very favourably towards\nconvalescence, the surgeon who attended her left her\nthree powders to allay pain and induce sleep. These\npowders were to be tatters in preserves' and on Tuesday\nmorning, the nurse having prrpared one for Mrs.\nRawlin, in order to give it to her as soon as she awoke\n(she was then sleeping with the child by her side)' left\n, the room. On her rcturn, Mrs. Rawlin told her that\nthe child had been out of bed and eaten \"the goody.\"\nHe was then snoring loudly, and although she tried to\nrouse him she could not, and he shortly afterwards died.\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death.\"\u2014\nWeeeli:ld Journal.\nTHE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF THE GREAT MONT-\nGOLFIER BALLOON. Exaggerated reports having ap-\npeared of the damage suffered by M. Goddard's balloon,\n\"The Eagle,\" pains have been taken to ascertain the\nfacts, which are these :\u2014M. Godard took up with him\nin his late ascent one passenger besides his own three\nassistants and the interpreter. He has experienced some\ndiffizulty at other times as well as on this oecasion in\nsecuring the balloon, owing to the country people being\nalarmed at its unusually large size, and therefore\nfearing to catch hold of the ropes, as they willingly. do\nwith a balloon of more moderate s;ze. On this occasion\nthe Eagle descended at first as favourably as could be\ndesired near Walthamstow ; but just at the moment of\nits descent a ground breeze suddenly arose, and being\ncoincident with the usual rebound of the balloon, carried\nit against the branch of a tree which tore the cotton\ncovering, though not seriously. M. Godard, shortly\nafterwards, when trying to lift the car, was so unfortu-\nnate as to step on a stone which turned under his foot,\nand be has thus sprained his amide. With this excep-\ntion none of the party were hurt, all having alighted in\nperfect safety, and having succeeded in securing the\nballoon, which will be repaired in a day or two. The\naccident to M. Godard is, however, unfortunate, as he\nis unable for a day or two to superintend matters\npersonally, and being obliged to go to Paris at once, no\nfurther ascent of the Eagle can take place here until\nhis return. He purposes, however, being in England\nagain by the latter end of the month, when he intends\nto make some ascents at Ct emorne, and will also most\nprobably visit the provinces for the same purpose.\nTHE NEW FACTORY Acsr.\u2014The new act to extend\nthe Factory Acts has just been printed, and contains a\nnumber of important provisions,. The object of the\nstatute is two-fold: to provide for the effectual cleansing\nand ventilation of factories; and to regulate the labour\nof children, young persons, and women employed therein.\nThe factories to which the act applies are those used\n\u2022for the manufacture of earthenware (except bricks and\ntiles), the manufacture of lucifer matches, of percussion\ncaps, of cartridges, paper staining, and fustian cutting.\nAn occupier of a factory not kept in conformity with\nthis act is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding \u00a3lO\nnor less than \u00a33. With the view of furthering the act\na master can make rules to ensure cleanliness and venti-\nlation which rules are to be approved cif by the Secre-\ntary of State, and if a person employed in the factory\nshould infringe them he is to be liable to a penalty of\n\u00a3l. The act provides that meals are not to be taken in\nfactories used for the purpose mentioned, and also pro.\n'vides the age of children to be employed\u2014sot under\neleven years of age.\n\nSHIPS OF WA_R BUILDING FOR Tin\n\nROYAL NAVY.\n\nThere are at the present time 36 vessels un-ler con-\nstruction at the various Royal and private dockyards for\nthe British navy, many of which are in a very forward\nstate for launching.

Our importations of wheat\nduring the six months were 7 per cent. less than the\nsame six months of 1863, but those of flour were 14 per\ncent. larder; so that the actual result, reckoning the two\nin their respective propertions, is that the quantity of\nforeign wheaten feed taken has this year been only\nabout 1 per cent. less than in lest year. Compared,\nhowever, with the first half of 1862, there has been a\nreduction of about 30 per cent. As regards other grain,\nour importations of barley have been 40 per cent. less\nthan those of the first half of 1863, of oats and beans\n60 per cent, less, of peas 47 per cent. less, and of Indian\ncorn nearly 87 per cent. less.\nWAGER ON THE WAR.\u2014About ten months ago two\ngentlemen of San Francisco laid a wager, by which one\nof the parties was beund to the following conditions\nIf the Federal forces did not capture Richmond within\n30 days flora that date, he was to give his opponent a\nsingle sound, eatable apple; if Richmond held out 60\ndays, he was ts give him two apples, and so on,\ndoubling the numher for each month until Richmond\nwas taken\u2014to the end of time, if that event did not\noccur before. Nine months have passed since the first\napple was handed over, and the list of apples delivered\nat the end of the successive months is as follows :-\n1,2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\u2014total, 511. Thus far it\nis all a good joke, and the loser has paid forfeits-\nregularly, with a good grace, but yesterday it ruined a\n10 dollar piece to meet the demand; apples are 15c. to\n20ce per lb., and it took a 501 b. box. Should Richmon'\nbe taken within the present month he would get back at\nthe apples he has lost, and one more, which would make\nhim more than eves, but should it hold out a year\nlonger, and he continue to pay his losses, his last pay-\nment would cost him 40,960 dols., and he would be\n81,900 dads. out; in three months more he would be out\n686,340 dols. ; and should the war last from this date as\nmuch longer as it has already\n_lasted since its com-\nmencement, no nation on earth could meet the terms of\nthe wager, even allowing it to be reduced to a cash basis.\nAlta California. -\nRECLAMATION OF THE WASH. A meeting of the\nmagistrates of the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire\nhas been held for the purpose of defining the boundaries\nof the counties of Norfolk and Lincolnshire in the large\ntract of land called Wingland. It appeared that the\nreclaimed land proposed to be divided consisted of about\n5,000 acres actually brought under cultivation, and\nabove 1,000 acres as yet only partially reclaimed. This\nwork of reclamation is part of the original scheme of\nmaking a new county, which was to be called Victoria\ncounty, and the district which now presents the aspect\nof highly-cultivated and richly productive fields, was\nbut a few years ago a dreary waste of alluvial mud, over\nwhich each tide pissed, but the immediate cause of the\nreclamation has neen the operation of the New Outten\nAct. The magistrates having agreed to the boundary\nline, which gives nearly an equal amount to either\ncounty, gave directions for the line to be marked out.\nThis is to be done by stone posts or landmarks. It\nshould be mentioned that this is but one portion of a\nvery large tract of land that is being, through engineer-\ning skill, taken from what has been known as the\nWash, but which would seem to have been ages back\ndry land, as the immense submarine forest stretching.\nacross the mouth of the Wash off Hunstanton indicates.\nMany thousands of acres have also been already\nreclaimed through the operations of the Norfolk Estuary\nscheme.\nTHE INCOME TAX.\u2014A return to Parliament shows\nthat the number of persons assessed under Schedule D\n(trades and professions) in Great Britain had increased\nin the year ending April 5, 1863, from 285,459 to 293,468;\nthe amount paid from \u00a33,222,033 to n,376,405 ; the in-\ncomes on which the tax was charged from \u00a389,013,493\nto \u00a393,322,864. The number of persons with less than\n\u00a3lOO a year had increased from 18,761 to 18,790 ,\u2022\nbetween \u00a3lOO and \u00a3l5O, from 135,262 to 139,297; and\nso on till thahiehest class, those with incomes of \u00a350,000\na year and upwards, who were 67 in 1862 and 80 in\n1863. In Ireland the number of persons charged had\nfallen off from 17,602 to 17,438; the amount paid from\n\u00a3168,132 to \u00a3167,834; and the incomes assessed from\n\u00a34,677,568 to \u00a34,673,743. The number paying on\nincomes of less than \u00a3lOO a year had diminished from\n1,264, to 1,224, but the number with \u00a350,000 a year and\nupwards had aisen from two to three.\nINDIAN STRATEGY.\u2014 One of the Fourteenth New\nj York Artillery\u2014a Seneca Indian\u2014undertook on a wager\nto bring in alive a rebel sharpshooter, who was perched\nin a tree in front of our line, considerably in advance of\nhis own. Procuring a quantity of pine boughs, he\nenveloped himself in them from head to foot, attaching\nthem securely to a branch, which he lashed lengthwise\nof hie body. When completed, he was indistinF,uishable\nto a casual observer from the surrounding foliage, and\nresembled a tree as closely as it was possible for his\nreally artistic efforts to render him. Thus prepared, and\nwith musket in hand, concealed likewise, he stole by\nalmost imperceptible movements to beneath the tree\nwhere the sharpshooter was lodged. Here he patiently\nwaited until his prey had emptied his piece at one of\nour men, when he suddenly brought his musket to bear\nupon the \" reb,\" giving him no time to reload. The\nsharpshooter was taken at a disadvantage. To the de-\nmand to come down he readily assented, when the\nIndian triumphantly marched him a prisoner into camp\nand won his wager.\u2014ettnerican Paper.\nTHE EFFECT OF MARRIAGE. Doubtless you have\nremarked, with satisfaction, how the little oddities of\nmen who marry rather late in life are pruned away\nspeedily after their marriage. You have found a man\nwho used to be shabbily and carelessly dressed, with a\nhuge shirt-collar frayed at the edges, and a glaring\nyellow silk pocket-handkerchief, broken of these things,\nan become a pattern of neatness. You have seen a\nman whose hair and whiskers were ridiculously cut\nspeedily become like other human beings. You have\nseen a clergyman who wore a long beard in a little\nwhile appear without one. You have seen a man who\nused to sing ridiculous sentimental songs leave them off.\nYou have seen a man who took snuff copiously, and\nwho generally had his breast covered with snuff, aban-\ndon the vile habit. A wife is the grand wielder of the\nmoral pruning-knife. If Johnson's wife had lived there\nwould have been no hoarding up of bits of orange-peel;\nno touching all the, posts in walking along the street;\nno eating and drinking with a disgusting voracity. If\nOliver Goldsmith had been married he would never\nhave worn that memorable and ridiculous coat. When-\never you find a man whom you know little about oddly\ndressed, or talking ridiculously, or exhibiting any\neccentricity of manner, you may be tolerably sure that\nhe is not a married man. For the little corners are\nrounded off, the little shoots ate pruned away, in\nmarried men. Wives generally have much more sense\nthan their husbands, especially when the husbands are\nclever men. The wive's advices are like the ballast\nthat keeps the ship steady.

The former suggests\nthat dividend ',warrants might be sent through the post\nthe, same as dividend orders of railway and other\npublic companies. The Bank of England reply that\nthere are practical difficulties in the way. The public\ntraitors are much more numerous than the shareholders\nin public companies, and neither their persons nor\naddresses are known to the Bank in the same way as the\nlatter are to the companies. .The bank system includes\natwofold protection\u2014first, from the stockholder having\nto take the initiative by making a claim; and second,\nfrom every claim being at once tested before the warrant\nis given up or payment made. If sent through the post\nthe warrants might go to the wrong address, or get into\nthe hands of the wrong parties, especially as deaths and\nchanges of address would be continually occurring.\nThe present system, moreover, is especially convenient\nto the bankers, through whom. the greater part of the\nmoney is pAd,\nfor those the ' warrants paid by the Bank of-\n&gland in cash being 40 per cent. of the whole dividend\nPai;(l.

George Waddington, Dean of Dur-\nham' died on the 20th inst., at the age of seventy-six.\nThe deceased graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge,\nand gained numerous University honours. He was\nmedallist 1811, University Scholar and Chancellor's\nmedallist for English verse in 1813; B.A. and Senior\nChancellor's medallist in 1815. He succeeded Dr.\nJenkinson in the Deanery of Durham in 1840, and\nwas installed on the 20th of September in that year.\nOn the death of Archdeacon Thorp, Warden of Dur-\nham University, the Dean succeeded him under an\norder in Council of the 4th June, 1841.

The Deanery, which is the first valuable\npiece of ecclesiastical preferment which has fallen to\nthe gift of Mr. Gladstone, is worth \u00a33,000 a year.\nArchdeacon Sandford is spoken of in some quarters as\nDr. Waddington's probable successor, and the names\nof Dr. Merivale, chaplain to the House of Commons,\nthe Rev. Dr. Kennedy, Regius Professor of Greek at\nCambridge, and Chancellor Alassingberd are also freely\nmentioned.\n\nDEATH FROM SUNSTROKE.\u2014On the 20th inst. an\ninquest was held at the Poplar Hospital upon the\nbody of Charles Solomon, 48. The deceased was a\nworking man. Two years tto-o he had sunstroke, from\nthe effects of which he never fully recovered. On the\n20th inst. he complained that he was losing his sight.\nThe jury returned a verdict of Suicide during insanity\nbrought on by sunstroke.\nFATAL ACCIDENT TO A MARQUIS.\u2014The Florence\njournals contain accounts of a frightful accident on the\nfashionable promenade of the Cascine. A number of\ncarriages were drawn up on the open space known as\nthe Piazzone, a favourite rendezvous in which gentle-\nmen are accustomed to proceed from one equipage to\nanother chatting with their friends, or presenting\ntheir compliments to ladies of their acquaintance.\nThe Marquis Alessandro Covino was standing at the\ndoor of the Countess Gherardi's landau, when the\nhorses of another vehicle taking fright, started off,\nand before the Marquis could get out of the way,\nknocked him down, and so fearfully injured him with\ntheir hoofs that he expired a few minutes after. The\ndeceased was about forty years of age, and the pos-\nsessor of a handsome fortune.\nSMOCKING ACCIDENT AT LLANDUDNO.\u2014This water-\ning place was on the 18th inst. the scene of a shocking\naccident. About five o'clock a jeweller named Griffiths,\naged 35 years, left his residence with a friend for the\npurpose of taking a walk round the Ormeshead.\nWhen about two miles round Mr. Griffiths dropped\nhis walking stick down the bank, and while descend-\ning in search of it he lost his hold and began rolling\ndown. His companion went to his aid, and found him\nclinging to a piece of rock that overhangs a precipice.\nHe gave Mr. Griffiths his handkerchief as a support\nuntil aid could be received, but the poor man could\nnot retain his hold many moments, and, letting go, he\nwas dashed on the rocks nearly twenty yards below.\nThe alarm was given in the town, and police-serjeant\nJones, with four boatmen, took a boat to the spot.\nThe body was found dreadfully mangled, and brought\nto the town. Deceased has left a wife and three\nchildren to mourn his loss.\nOPENING OF NEW RAGGED SCHOOLS AT WALWORTH.\u2014\nOn the 19th inst. new ragged schools were opened in\nLock's-fields, Walworth.

She endeavoured\nto prevent him, and he then struck he in the face and\nthree times on the neck. She gave him into custody,\nand on the wtey to the station Brown attempted to push\nhim away from the constable.\nThe prisoner Richardson said he was passing the\nhouse in question, which is situated next door to the\nentrance to a chapel, when he saw two women\nhalf naked sitting at the parlour window, and they\nbeckoned him to go up. He did so, and after some\nconversation a disturbance took place, but he did not\nstrike any woman.\nThe other prisoner said he was drunk, and did not\nknow what he was about. _\n\n_\nMr. Barker asked the witness if the defence was\ntrue, and what sort of a house it was?\nWitness: It is a quiet house, and my master and\nmistress are milliners, but I never see any work done\nor anything wrong, I can assure you. There was only\none \"young lady\" in the house, and she had on a low\ndress, and that was, perhaps, what the prisdner meant\nby saying the females were half-naked. There was\nnever anything wrong done at the house she would\nmost solemnly assure the magistrate.\nMr. Alexander (second clerk)\u2014But you have several\nyoung women lodging there, have you not?\u2014come,\ntell the truth about it.\nWitness: There are some \"young ladies\" lodging\nthere who are visited by their friends, but I never saw\nanything wrong.\nMr. Alexander: And the \" friends \" you speak of\nare generally men?\nWitness: Oh, yes, they are \" gentlemen ; lowpeople\ndo not come to our house.\n_\n\nA stylishly-dressed woman got into the box, said\nher name was Edwards, and that she resided in the\nhouse in question. Ido nothing. I am a \"kept\nlady.\"\nMr. Barker: What do you mean by that?\n'Witness: I am under the \"protection\" of a \"gen-\ntleman,\" who keeps me, and provides for me. Wit-\nness saw the assault, and so did her \"lady friend.\"\nThey were both at the window when the prisoners\npassed.\nThe \"lady friend\" was called, and described herself\nas a \"miss,\" and stated she was under the protection\nof a \"gentleman,\" and was not ashamed to own it:\nShe saw the assault.\nMr. Barker finel the first-named prisoner 10s., and\nthe other ss.\nThe fines were paid.\n\nSAD CASE OF ELOPEMENT AND ITS\n\nRESULT.\n\nCharlotte Leach, aged 28, with a very fair face and\nlong, golden, wavy hair and eyelashes, described as a\nprostitute and married woman, was charged before Mr.\nBarker,.at Clerlienwell Police Court, with attempting\nto commit suicide by taking a quantity of sugar of\nlead.\nlititry-AlatvVEttrneb, the keeper of a low brothel at\n11, Little Drummond-street, Somers' Town, said the\ndefendant had lodged with her a little over a month.\nShe is a married woman, and her friends are highly\nrespectable. On Monday last she went to Woolwich\nand returned with a soldier. On Tuesday she got up and\nwent out and returned with a large quantity of sugar\nof lead, which she mixed with some hot water and\ndrank. The women gave an alarm, and a surgeon was\nsent for, who having administered an emetic advised\nher removal to the hospital. There the stomach pump.\nwas used, and a large quantity of sugar of lead re-\nmoved from her. She had heard the prisoner since\nthen say that she was tired of her life, and that she\nwas determined to destroy herself, as she had no one\nto live or care for.\n\nPolice-serjeant Parry, 47 S, said that he took the\ndefendant into custody, and even after she had taken\nan emetic and been attended to at the hospital she\nbrought up more poison whilst at the police-station.\nThe defendant then appeared in a low, desponding\nstate, and seemed deeply to regret the act she was\nfooliEh enough to attempt to commit. She also said.\nthat her husband, when she married him, was an\narchitect and marble carver, that she left him, and\nthat he then sold his business, and is now an officer\neither in the Sappers and Miners or the Royal\nArtillery. Her friends are highly respectable, and\nmentioning the name of her brother, said that he\nis now mayor of a country town and iii a large way\nof business. He believed from what he had heard\nthat her statement was true. The defendant, although\nshe had eloped from her husband, and was leading\na disreputable life, mixing as she did with some of\nthe lowest prostitutes in Somers' Town, and residing\nat a notorious brothel, was generally well conducted,\nand \u2022 very quiet person. When she was takerf in cus-\ntody she said she was very unhappy, and at the hos-\npital it was stated that she had taken poison enough\nto kill a horse.\n\nThe defendant, who seemed very downcast, said that\nshe did not care what was done to her, or what be-\ncame of her.\n\nMr. Barker said it would not be safe for her go at\nlarge at present, and therefore he should remand her\nto the House of Detention until Weinesday next. She\nwould then see the chaplain, and he trusted that she\nwould pay attention to his advice, and se the folly of\nher wicked act. By Wednesday next he hoped her\nfriends would hear where she was, and come forward\nand take her away from her present bad associates.\nThe defendant, who began to cry, was then re-\nmoved.\n\nTHE BRIGHTON RAILWAY ACCIDENT.\u2014On Wednes-\nday, Mr. W. Carter concluded the inquiry, at Streat-\nham, into the circumstances connected with the\nBrighton railway accident on the 29th of May last.\nAfter several persons employed on the line had been\nexamined, Mr. John Scott Russell was calledly Mr.\nFaithful, on behalf of the company. He stated that he\nconsidered tank engines the safest and best kind of\nengine that could be used for traffic on this particular\nline, namely, between Victoria, London-bridge, and\nCroydon. He had heard nothing to account for the\naccident, except the irregular shutting off of the steam.\nColonel Yolland, who had made an inquiry by direc-\ntion of the Board of Trade, said that the permanent\nway was not strong enough to bear the weight of the\nengine and carriages running at such a speed. He\ndid not think it expedient to run at the rate of sixty\nmiles an hour with tank engines having eighteen feet\nsix inches wheel basis, especially when the engine was\nnot tightly screwed up to the break van behind it.\nThe jury, after deliberating for an hour, returned the\nfollowing verdict :\u2014\" That the deceased persons seve-\nrally came by their deaths from accident, and we, the\njury, are of opinion that it was attributable to the\nhigh rate of speed at which the express trains run over\nthe line from Croydon to Victoria. The jury would\nurge on the directors of the London and Brighton\nCompany the necessity of allowing more time for the\nperformance of the journey, and that careful attention\nshould be given to the coupling of the trains.\"\nSHOCKING AND FATAL ACCIDENT.\u2014Mr. Walthew\nheld an inquiry at the Queen's Head Tavern, High-\nstreet, Poplar, respecting the death of Joseph Fingane,\naged 25, who was killed under the following shocking\ncircumstances :\u2014Deceased was a painter, and on last\nFriday morning he was employed in decorating the\nbows of the ship East in Messrs. Carter and Co.'s dry\ndock, Millwall. While in the act of stepping from one\npart of a lofty stage to another the platform suddenly\noverset, and deceased was thrown headlong to the\nbottom of the dock, a distance of nearly forty feet.\nHe came upon his head, and was killed instanta-\nneously, his remains being shockingly mangled. The\naccident arose, it was said, entirely through the fault\nof deceased in stepping upon a wrong portion of the\nstage. A verdict of accidental death was returned.\n\nCOLLISION AND Loss OF LIFE ON THE THAMES.\nMr. Humphreys held an inquiry at the Albion Tavern,\nHigh-street, Shadwell, into the circumstances of a\ncollision between an outward-bound ship and a Trinity\nHouse ballast lighter, by which Benjamin Livermore,\ncaptain of the latter, lost his life. Verdict, acci-\ndental death.\n\nMas.

It appeared that on the evening in\nquestion, while the prosecutrix and her father and\nmother were sitting qu;etly at the fire in their own\nhouse, the door was opened, and the prisoners walked\nin. The prisoner Bryan was the first who caught\nhold of the prosecutrix and then the prisoner Luke\nseized her, and they brought her to the house of a\nperson named Haran, who a ied about two miles off,\nwhere she remained during the rest of the night,\nsitting by the fire, and talking to the Hara,ns and the\nprisoner Luke, and drinking punch. It appeared\nthat the prisoner Luke and the prosecutrix had been\ncourting, and at a dance a few nights previous to the\nabduction she hinted to him that her father was\nagainst the match, still, if he came and took her away,\nshe would not be very unwilling. The taking of her\nout of her father's house was accompanied with a\nshow of violence, and her clothes were dirtied, and a\npetticoat left on the road, and the two prisoners ap-\npeared to drag her away, but the moment she got\naway from the paternal eye she went very quietly to\nHara,n's house. The cross-examination of the prose -\ncurrix, who is a very good-looking girl, caused great\namusement, by her pretended unwillingness to admit\nany connivance on her part, or that she admired the\nprisoner Luke, while, on a little coaxing by the\nlearned counsel who defended, she admitted the facts\nas above stated. The prisoners were acquitted.\n\nAT THE Windsor petty sessions John Sturgess, the\nson of a respectable builder of that town, was charged\nwith stealing forage from the Cavalry hal racks.

According\nto the arrangements for the succession, he is\nfollowed in the Pachalic by Ismail, a son of the\nlate Ibrahim, and grandsonS of Mahomet Ali.\nThe death of Said Pacha may change the polio),\nof Egypt. During his reign it has been liberal,\nand yet administered under French influence.\nLouis Napoleon, in a letter to the general of\nhis army in Mexico, avows his purpose to be\nthe establishment of a Mexican monarchy, to\narrest the progress of the Anglo-Saxon race\nsouthward, and to secure the ascendancy of\n\"the Latin race,\" a figment invented for his\npurposes on part of the American continent.\nThis declaration some time ago would have\nroused the wrath of the -Union, and brought '\naid to Mexico from the North; but the Con-\nfederates and the Federals are now alike\nhelpless, and the latter are engaged in raising\nMexicans in the north of that country for the\ninvasion of Texas.\n\nThe battle at Fredericksburgh begins only\nnow to be undei stood. For some time the\nlosses on the Federal side seemed inadequate\nto explain the excitement caused by the dis-\naster among them. Their army numbered\nninety thousand men, and the loss of one-\nninth in killed and wounded, although a large\nproportion, would not fully explain the depres-\nsion caused by this failure in the North. The\ndate of the battle made it the last move for\nRichmond in the season. The expectations\nformed from a new general, with a sterner\npolicy than his predecessor, were rudely\nscattered. Rumour probably exaggerated the\nactual losses sustained; the figures officially\npublished have underrated them. Perhaps the\napparent discrepancy may be explained by the\ndispersion of survivors. A British officer who\nseems to have been present estimates the\nkilled and wounded Federals at 15,000, but\nhe adds 25,000 men in addition had disap-\npeared. He asserts that the fighting was\nchiefly done, and the loss mainly sustained by\nthe Irish Brigade. An officer in that brigade\nwrites that on the day after the battle, four of\nits regiments mustered only 36 officers and\n223 men! The battle had been disastrous to\nthe Irish.\n\nAt Murfreesboro the Federals after five days\nof fighting remained in possession of the town,\nwhich had been frequently captured and re-\ncaptured, but the Confederates retreated with\n28 pieces of captured cannon and 4,000 pri-\nsoners. the loss of life is described as terrible.\nThe Federals alone had 19 Colonels killed or\nwounded; and the loss of men is proportion-\nately severe. The result of the combats at\nVicksburgh at the same dates- is not clearly\nknown, but the fate of that stronghold may\nhave been decided before the despatch of the\nCanard Steamer, which may be expected during\nthe day.\n\nFive- to six millions sterling in notes form\nthe arrears due to the Federal army. They are\nto be paid in documents worth a third under\npar. The loan schemes now before Congress\nsum up to close on three hundred millions ster-\nling. But they cannot all be used even if all\nbe voted. A limit must exist to borrowing in\nthe money market, and we suppose it to be\nnearly reached.\n\nItaly is deficient in forty millions sterling\nfor the budgets of 1863 and 1864, and will\nborrow half of the sum, not objecting to the\nwhole if it could be obtained during the present\nyear.\n\nThe Duke of Saxe-Cobourg is likely to accept\nGreece, and the Greeks may take him as a\nmake-shift, knowing perhaps that Prince Alfred\nis his heir, will be Duke of Saxe-Cobourg, and\nonce in that position may act for himself in any\nfuture opening on the Greek throne.\nMany Meetings of members of parliament.\nwith their constituents, have occurred during\nthe last two weeks. Not a word of reform has\nbeen spoken at one of these. Mr. Bright and\nMn Scholefield were oltupied with interna-\ntional law. Mr. Baines explained Austrian\nimprovements. Mr. Milner Gibson advocated\nthe interests of the Federals. Mr. Hope was\nenthusiastic in favour of .the South. Mr,\nAyrton has a strong leaning that way. Lord\nFerraoy and Mr. H. Lewis hold with the\nNorth. The 'general opinion is favourable to I\ndoing nothing in the quarrel.\nA slight improvement is again noticed in\nthe cotton districts, but as not much over half\nthe quantity necessary can come from India in\n1863, and perhaps an equivalent\n.for a day's\nconsumption weekly from all other quarters, it\nwould be vain to expect the old quantity of\nwork in cotton before 1864.\n\nParliament reassembles in a few days, but\nthe coming session will pass as the last did,\nwith no advance in Reform, for the public are\neasily occupied with any foreign topic: and\nwhile they can be diverted from attention to\ntheir own business by remote incidents, they\nmay bie assured that it will be neglected.\n\nTHE EXTRAVAGANCE OF ECONOMY.\n. WE noticed in our last number the relation\nbetween the desire to save money and 'the\ndestruction of life; and stated the possibility\nof showing that saving often caused a great\nloss of property. Nothing is dearer than\nsaving in certain circumstances. A family try\nto save money on house rent, and pay twice\nthe economy out in doctor's bills and medicine.\nThe process is so common that, perhaps, a\nfalse economy is the greatest waste in, all the\nworld.\n\nNearly six weeks have passed since the _ex-\nplosion in the Edmund's Main coal pit. These\nweeks have been unproductive to the owners.\nThey have been spent in flooding the pit, and\nthat task being\n,now nearly accomplished,\ndouble the time will be required in pumping\nout the water. The expense and loss must\nreach to very many thousand pounds. They\nwill be equivalent to the price of a fine estate,\nall incurred for the purpose of saving the\ndifkrence between blasting by gunpowder and\nby hand labour. Similar practices exist in\nother although similar places. Gunpowder\nis employed in other pits, where it should\nnever be burned, or should never be seen; but\nall the money ever saved by its use, and much\nmore than all that money is probably lost in\nthis single explosion.\n\nThe Hartley pit calamity is fresh in all\nmemories. It would have been averted, or\ngreatly mitigated, by the existence of a supple-\nmentary communication, between the work-\nings or a second shaft. We know that\n\u00a370,000 was subscribed for the purpose of\nreplacing to the families of the lost men the\nvalue of their labour. A smaller sum was em-\nployed for that object, but it would be cruel\nmockery to suppose the.provision thus made\nby the public for survivors to be an equivalent\nfor the wages that would\u2022 have been earned\nI and employed in their behalf by their relatives,\nexcept for the catastrophe that cut their lives\nprematurely short. One hundred 'thousand\npounds would not be a high-pitched estimate\nof the loss sustained by the public from the\nwant of a second shaft at the Hartley coal pit;\nand the difference between the necessary out-\nlay and that large sum was lost by the desire to\nbe extremely economical. The loss to the re-\nlatives of the workmen formed, however, only\none item in a large account, and might not have\ninterfered with the means of the proprietors;\nbut it is obvious that a second shaft would\nhave been economy to them. They might by\nits aid have overcome the inundation of their\npit, and have saved from destruction property\nof great value.\n_ _ _ _\n\nrihe same facts exist in every trade. Half\nthe ships wrecked on our shores are said to\nperish from inadequate material, or from being\nunder-manned or weak handed. Economy of a\nfew shillings per cwt. on iron cables has often\ncost to insurers or owners as many thousand\npounds. In losses by fire or wreck we frequently\nread that the property was insured. Such in-\nformation is so common that readers appear to\nbelieve, when pro.perty is insured, that nothing\nhas been lost. Loss is not reduced by insur-\nance, but only transferred from one party to a\nnumber of persons. Some men say that half\nthe vessels lost annually are wrecked on account\nof marine insurance. They are ndi, bad hearted\nenough to suppose that the wrecks occur pur-\nposely and from sheer wickedness but what\nthey say leaves the blame with the practice\nrather than the practitioners of marine insur-\nance. This statement amounts to no more\nthan this\u2014that owners put ships to sea in a\ncondition which would be iniproved if the risk\nrested exclusively on themselves, and were not\ntaken chiefly by the insurers; but this state-\nment is sufficiently bad, and requires some in-\nquiry into its truth, and if it be found true,\ncalls for legislative surveillance over the ship-\nping interest.\n\nThe truth of the statement has never been\ndisputed on adequate authority, and no prac-\nti cal seaman entertains any 'doubt of it; yet\nthe nation continues in the old course allow-\ning not only the destruction of life, but even\nof an extravagant amount of property. An\ninquiry into the cause of accidents in any\nother profession will bring out the same result.\nIn building, in manufactories, in mechanical\nshops, we generally ind the rage for economy\nis the cause of accidents. The boiler of an '\nengine bursts, and single explosion destroys\nmore property than the worth of a dozen or a ,\nscore of !new boilers, or the cost of proper I\nsupervision for a century. The great railway\naccidents in the neighbourhood of London in\n1861 arose from the employment or over-\nworking of badly-paid men in positions of\ntrust, and they cost more money to the share-\nholders than they will save by shabby economy,\nlow wages, and over\u2014time and over-work to\nthe close of this century. The great accident\nof 1862 on the Edinburgh and Glasgow rail-\nway so clearly originated in an extravagant\neconomy, that even the manager of the com-\npany has been committed to take his trial for\nthe offence by the legal officials. He may be\nperfectly innocent, but an idea must . exist\nthat proper measures were not adopted to\nsecure the safe conveyance of the passengers,\nwhile the company in saving five pounds lost\nfifty thousand pounds on that day.\n","446088":"REVOLT IN THE SHAN STATES.\n\nWe take the following from the Cakulta Eng:iJhman\nof 22nd December :\n\nThe rumour that the Shan States, tributary to the\nring of Burmah, had broken out in open revolt, is not\naltogether without foundation. The cause of quarrel\nlay in the fact that one of the chiefs of the rebellious\nStates, named Aloung-Naw-Pah, had been summoned\nto the court at Man'delay, and incarcerated without aRy\nprovocation, by older of the King. Having effected his\nescape from prison, he n 3 sooner set foot on his\nown territory than he ordered all the Burmese officiAs\nand their subordinates, to the number of 300, to be killed.\nThe rest of the chiefs of the Shan States having assem-\nbled a force of above 8,000 armed men, threw off their\nallegiance to the Burmese crown, and placed themselves\nin an attitude of defiance. A movement such as this is\nfar from surprising, the Burmese Government being\nthoroughly detested for its rapacTty and cruelty to all\nwho come within its influence. In consequence of this\noutbreak the King of Burmah has ordered a conscription\nto be enforced to fill the ranks of the army destined to\nact against the Shan States, but there appears no doubt\nwhatever of the success of the chiefs and the dtscomfi-\ntura of his golden-footed Majesty.\n\nHORNIMAN'S TEA is choice and strong, tnoderate in\nprice, and wholesome to use. hese advantages have\nsecured for this Tea a general preference. It is sold in\n\u201ePackets by 2,280 Agents.\nTHE CHURCH ON THE CoNTINENT.\u2014We are informed\nthat at Stuttgardt, where commercial considerations and\neducational advantages combine to attract a gradually\nincreasing number of our countrymen, the British\nchaplain, who has long urged upon his congregation the\nnecessity of building a suitable church, has just had the\nmunificent sum of \u00a32,000 placed at his disposal for the\npurpose.\n\nSitoexixo MACHINERY ACCIDENT\u2014On January 25.\nan accident, attended with fatal consequences, occurred\nin the shop of a gun polisher, at Birmingham. As it\nwas becoming dark, a lad of eleven years of age, named\nMullins, crept beneath a work-bench for the purpose of\nturning on the gas. In doing so his clothing was\ncaught in some of the bands of the machinery, and in\nan instant he was dragged up to the pulley, and whirled\nround the shaft with great rapidity, at every revolution\nbeing dash I with great force first against the bench\nabove, next against the wall behind, and then dragged\nthrough the narrow space between the shaft and the\nfloor. The unfortunate lad was frightfully mangled......\nliterally torn to pieces\u2014his brains being dashed out,\nand his limbs torn from his body. There being no\nother person in that part of the premises at the time, it\nwas tea or fifteen minutes lefore the accident was dis-\ncovered and the machinery stopped.\n81NC:11:MAU ACCIDENT IN TILE METROPOLIS. DT.\nLankester held an inquest at Middlesex Hospital on the\nbody of a young man named John Timbs, in the employ\nof Messrs. Palmer and Rogers, the linendrapers of\nRegent street.

He fell down and was jammed by a\nheavily-laden coal waggon: He died in a few hours\nfrom the injuries received. A question arose whether\nthe occurrence was an act of suicide or an accident. An\nassistant in the establishment described the deceased as\nVery cheerful but nervous, and they had no doubt he\nhad slipped down in crossing.\nTun TALLY SYSTEM.\u2014An inquest has been held at\nFalmouth on the body of a woman named Mary Ann\nAngrove' who poisoned herself.

Mr. Holliday, Mayor of Birmingham, occupied\nthe chair.\n_ _\n\nMr. G. Dixon moved the folloWi.ng resolution: \"The\npresent House of Commons, having been elected on the\nquestion of reform, and the majority of its members\nhaving pledged themselves to promote an extension of\nthe franchise, this meetit g records its opinion that the\nPar.iament has failed in its duty in not having passed\na measure which would have admitted a large number\nof the unenfranchlsed to a real share in the government\nof the nation. This meeting believes the present period\nto be favourable to the passing of such a measure, the\nnecessity for which has on various occasions been en-\nforced by her Majesty's Ministers, and by the leaders\nof both political parties.\"\nThe motion, havit.g been seconded, was put, and\nunanimously agreed to.\nMr. Scholefield, M.P., believed many useful measures\nhad been passed during last ses,ion, and he knew of none\nof an obnoxious character, except those odious restrictions\nin reference to the game laws which both himself and\nhis colleague had opposed to the utmost of their power.\nHe was not sanguine that any great measure would be\npassed next s, ssion ; the reins of government were in\nhands that were not strong. Nor (Id he believe, although\nthe resolution ref( rred to a reform bill, as a question of\nimportance, that the present Parliament would ever take\nthat question up in a manner to justify the expectations\nwhich appeared to be entettqined. He thought the\nGovernment w( re perf, ctly right in refusing to enter\ninto the congress pt oposed to them by France ; but he\nregretted that the manner in which that overture from\nFrance was met had been more logical than courteous.\nAs to the Danish difficulty, he lid not profess to be\nmaster of all the complications of the question; but he\nsincerely hoped that we should not allow ourselves to be\nmixed up in it. When in 1862 he stated his,\nviews with regard to the American civil war he hoped\nit wouhl not have been necessary for him again to allude\nto the subject. Ile had not e)anged his opinion, how-\never unpopular that opinion might be. He was asked\nif he was ready to plunge this country into war by re-\ncognition of the Southern Confederacy, or if he was\nprepared to call upon the Government to break the\nblockade. With regard to the blockade, if the legal ad-\nvisers of the Crown said that there was a legal b!ockade,\nhe for one would not lift his little finger,to break it;\nand if by recognition war was implied, then he would\nrecoil from it with horror. He contended that recogni-\ntion was not a departure from neutrality, and that it\nonly implied the moral effect of public opinion. He\nthought that secession was an act of folly on the part of\nthe South, but it was not for strangers or foreigners to\njudge what amount of oppression would justify revolt.\nHis own opinion was that however foolish and illegal\nthe secession may have been, it was a moral right con-\nceded by the Declaration of Independence, and sanc-\ntioned by President Lincoln himself. Secession was no\nnew thing in America; there was a secession in 1814.\nIt was a secession of the New England States. Being\nopposed to the war, they not only seceded, but raised a\nflag of their own. How was it that what was held to\nbe patriotism then was now to be regarded as treachery\nand impolicy ? He urged that the present war was not a\nwar for the emancipation of the slaves, and if it were\nit was not the less on that account an immoral\nand unjustifiable war. The preservation of the Union\nwas the great idea which pervaded the minds\nof the Northerners, from the President downwards.\nHe believed that it was impossible to restore the Union\nby war. If this was a war for the emancipation of the\nslave, then he said most emphatically that it was. an\nimmoral war.\n\nMr. Bright then presented himself and said: There\nare two subjects which have been treated upon by my\nhon. colleague about which I would just say a few words\nbefore I coins to those matters on which 1 had intended\nto speak. The first is the question which now keeps\nEurope in suspense, which may end in a war, or may\nend in some diplomatic aecomodation of a long-standing\nquarrel. I will not go into the history of the Danish\nand German dispute. I agree entirely with every word\nthat my hon. colleague spoke upon that question; and I\nwill say further, that if there be a possible Govern-\nment in our day that will plunge this country\ninto war under the pretence of maintaining the\nbalance of power in Europe, and sustaining any king-\ndom there, be it little or great, that Government not\nonly is not worthy the confidence of the people of Eng-\nland, but deserving of our execration and abhorrence.\nI came here intending to say no single word as to the\nquestion between North and South in the United States.\nMy opinion is that the unanimous judgment of the\npeople of England, so far as that is ever shown upon\nany public occasion, is in favour of the course which\nher Majesty's Government have publicly declared it to\nbe their intention to pursue. I believe that my hon.\nfriend is mistaken in the view which he takes of the\nmeaning and of the result of what he calls the recogni-\ntion of the South. I have seen it stated by authority,\nNorth as well as South, and by authority which I may\nterm English, and by authority from France, that, in\nthe present condition of the quarrel, recognition,\nby al the usages of nations, must necessarily\nlead to something more. I believe that, looking\nto the past usage of this country with regard to the\nrebellion of the Greeks against the Turks, and with\nregard to the revolt of the colonies of South America\nagainst Spain, it can be demonstrated that these\ncmes afford no support whatever to the argument that\nwe are permitted to recognise the South; and that if\nsuch recognition did take place now, it could only ex-\nasperate still more the terrible strife which exists on\nthe North American continent, and would spread that\nstrife over Europe itself. Now, I am myself of opinion\nthat the people of America, so capable in every way,\nwould settle the difficulties of that continent without\nasking the old countries of Europe to take any share in\nthem. I believe that, in the providence of the Supreme,\nthe slaveholder, untaught and unteachable by fact or\nargument or Christian precept, has been permitted to\ncommit, I will not call it the crime, but the act of\nsuicide upon himself. I look forward to the time when\nI shall stand on this platform with my honourable col-\nleague, and when he will join with me in rejoicing\nthat there does not breathe a slave on the North\nAmerican continent\u2014that the Union has been com-\npletely restored- and not less will he rejoice that\nEngland did not in the remotest manner, by a word or\na breath, or the raising of a finger, or the setting of a\ntype, do one single thing to promote the atrocious\nobject of the leaders of this accursed insurrection.\nOn the 24th of November I had the opportunity\nof making a speech in the town of Rochdale. On\nthat occasion I took the opportunity of object-\ning to those persons who think that everything is\ndone in this country that need to be done, and that\neverybody is so happy that politics are at an end. I\nspoke of the question of the million, or million and a\nhalf of our labouring population employed in cultivating\nthe soil. From that time to this there has been discus-\nsion in the newspapers about what was said on that\noccasion. Now what I said to that meeting on the\nsubject of the land was this\u2014l should say, if we were\nfairly represented, that feudalism, with regard to the\nland of England, should be abolished, and that the\nagricultural labourer throughout the United Kingdom\nshould be redeemed from that poverty and serfdom which\nup to this time has been his lot. The Times newspaper\ncontained eommenta on that portion of the speech, and\nMr. Cobden came forward to assail Mr. Delane, the editor,\nwith regard to the charge against me. He found a\nman in a mask endeavouring to stab me in the back, for\nhe had not seen that the same man had been in the\nprevious article also stabbing him, and he came forward\nand dragged his mask from \\him, and showed him,\nwith whatever lineaments he is distinguished, to\nthe gaze of the whole nation and the whole world.\nAfter denial and equivocation, this unmasked editor\nof this great journal was obliged to retire from the per-\nsonal part of this controversy, and to skulk back into\nthe anonymous, which suits him better. Neither Mr.\nCobden nor I hailre ever said anything to show that\nwe thought it desirable to abolish by force of law\nanonymous writing in our newspapers; but Mr.\nCobden laments as I do, and as you all do,\nthat the anonymous system is inevitably a\nshelter for a man who has no sense of honour.\nThe Times newspaper is a power in this country, and a\npower in Europe. No man laments more than I do that\nso much power should be associated with what I will call\na godless intellect and a practical atheism. The editor\nof the Times is now domesticated in the houses of\nCabinet Ministers and members of high families in Lon-\ndon. Unless what I say now may make it difficult, I\nthink that some day Mr. -Walter, the proprietor, or chief\nproprietor of that paper, may find himself placed\nin the House of Peers as a compensation for the services\nrendered to the present Prime Minister of England.\nMy argument at Rochdale was this that the agricultural\nlabouring population of the caantry was in a deplorable\ncondition; and I believed that, to a large extent, it was\nto be attributed to the unsound and unjust laws which\nregulate the possession and distribution of land. Con-\ntrary to what exists in some countries, we have the\ngreat classes connected with the landowner who is\nalways becoming richer, that is, if he does not spend too\nmuch. The land is always becoming more valuable.\n(A voice, \"And so is the cotton-owner.\") You find\nthe tenant farmer occupying larger farm, and with\nmuch greater apparent wealth; but if you come to the\nlaLourers who cultivate the land you find those labourers\nat a greater distance from the landlord, and from the tenant,\nproh tbly th\u2018n they were almost at any former period.\nYou may ask me very reasonably what is the difference\nbetween the laws of their country and the laws of ours,\nand what changes do you propose? In the greatest\nportion of the Continent? of Europe\u2014the state of the\nlaw is this. It follows what I believe to be the natural\nlaw of affection and justica between parents and chil-\ndren, that a large portion of t'e property of the parent\n\nmust be by will; or, if not by will, the law will order\nit to be equally divided amongst the caildren. That is\nthe case with respect to all property but land. All the\nprop rty of the parent, according to the number of his\nchildren' must be divided amongst them' except what\nmay be bequeathed by will. You are to be frightened\nby this law of bequest as if it was something very\ndreadiul. Why, it only follows the rule which mer-\nchants and manufacturers and all other people in\nVie world have followed in latter days, fa treating\ntheir children with equal affection and equal justice.\nGo to the United States, and you will see a different\nstate of the law from what you will find in this country.\nThere a man may leave his property as he likes among\nhis children, because the United States law believes that\nnatural affection and justice form of themselves a suffi-\ncient law in the majority of cases, and therefore that it\nis not necessary to enforce them by any statutt. If a\nman dies without a will, the law of the United States\ntakes his property, and, looking upon his children with\nequ l affection and equal justice, m tires that distriba-\ntion which it believes the just and loving parent would\nhave made. Bat if you come to this country, what do\nyou find? This: that with regard to all kinds of\nproperty, except that wlich is called real property\u2014the\nland of the country and the houses upon it\u2014our law\ndoes exactly the same. It divides it equally amongst\nthe chi'dren, because it knows that is what the parent\nshould have done, and would have done if he had been\na good parent. But when it omes to the question of\nland, then\u2014contrary to the European law, which makes\na statute according to natural justice\u2014contrary to the\nUnited States law, which when there is no will\nmakes a law in accordance with nat Aral justice\u2014our\nlaw does exactly that which nat.:sal justice would forbid.\nPersonalty, that is, property which is Rot land, is\ndivided equally; the property which is land is not di-\nvided equally, but is given to the oldest son in a lump.\nNow tell me if that is not a more just law, approving\nitself to the hearts of men and. before the eye of\nHeaven, than the law by which we send as beggars\ninto the world half a dozen children, in order that we\nmay make one rich in the possession of the land. The\nobject of entailing laud is to keep great estates together,\nand in one family. Under this system land in this\ncountry is sometimes tied up for fifty, eighty, or a hun-\ndred years and no person has the power to sell it, how-\never advantageous it may be to the proprietors them-\nselves, and to the public, that the land should be sold.\nThis state of things is maintained for the very reason\nfor which this system was established 800 years ago,\nthat there may be in this country a handful of persons\nwho are the owners of nearly all the land of the country,\nin whose hands is concentrated nearly al the\npower by whom the Government of the country\nis mainly conducted, and amongst whom the pa-\ntronage of the Government is mainly distributed.\nIn every country of the world, as far as I know,\nthe possessors of land are the possessors of power.\nI believe that these great properties give great political\npower, and that this, which we call our great territorial\nsystem, prevails to an extent in this country which is\nprobably unknown in any other, and leaves the cultiva.\ntors of the soil ignorant, and hopeless, and degraded.\nThere is a great tendency to larger farms throughout\nthe country which makes it still more difficult for a\nlabourer even to become a tensnt, or even to rise above his\npresent condition. For fear that the man in the mask\nshould misrepresent my views, let me tell you that 1 am\nnot . against great estates, or great farmers, or\ngreat properties, or great factories; but I have\na great desire to see small estates, and small\nfarmers, and 'small factories. In this country, where\nthere is such a great creation of wealth, there is\nalways a great desire for the accumulation of land.\nThere is always a tendency in this country, especially\nwhere we have so much manufacturing and commercial\nindustry and wealth, to buy estates; their possession\ngives great social position and great po'itical influence.\nI am not complaining of this; it is a natural and a just\nand a healthy thing. It is desirable that the farmer\nshould have the stimulus of ambition to acquire larger\nfarms, and that even those possessing estates - should\nwish to acquire larger estates. This is the stimulus\nwhich leads men to strive for something honourab!e in\nthis country. But to leave all these influenees working\nin that direction' and to add to this influence the force\nof a most intricate and complicated system of law\u2014to\ngive all these forces still greater force is, in my\nopinion, contrary to all the true interests of England;\nand I believe that if it goes on in this way for\nanother half-century as it has been for the\nlast half-century, it may cause discontent and great\nembarrassment within this now peaceful kingdom.\nSuppose a man has money in the bank, suppose he has\nmachinery in a mill, or merchandise in a warehouse, or\nshares and parchments in his safe, when he dies the law\nmakes a distribution of all that property in accordance,\nas I believe, with the principle of natural parental affec-\ntion and justice. I say, let that principle be exteaded\nto all property of which a man may die possessed. In\nthat respect I want to go no further. With regard to\nthe question of entail, I only pro-pose this: that a man\nmay leave his property to any persons who may be living\nat the time he makes his will; but at present he can\nleave to a number of people, and to the child unborn, and\nthat may not be born until twenty years after the making\nof the will. I would alter that system. I should be\ncontent to have the property left to persons\nin existence, and whose names should appear\nin the will; and you won't find, as A., 8., or C. died\noff, that the property would come into the hands\nof a man who would have the absolute disposal\nof it. Now everything which I am proposing\nis carried out to a somewhat greater extent in the\nUnited States\u2014in most of the States\u2014and to a greater\nextent on the continent of Europe, and it is being car-\nried out in all the Australian colonies. Now is there a\nman here who cannot understand the question mode-\nrately well in the way in which I have endeavoured to\nput it? Is this spoliation? Is this agrarian outrage?\nIs this stimulating working men and the agricultural\nlabourer\u2014to what shall I say? Incendiarism or any-\nthing else he may have recourse to? It is nothing of\nthe kind. It is laying before them just principles of\nlaw, admitted to be just in every other country in\nthe world except this, and which we admit to he\njust in regard to everything else charged with all sorts\nof dreadful things by that gentleman in the mask.\nI will say to the landowners that their interests are\nbound up with the interests of the people in the right\nsolution of this question. I would ask to what are they\ntending under the operation of these laws? They are\nbecoming every year smaller and smaller in numbers;\nthe large ones are rapidly eating up the small ones.\nThe census returns show that the numbers of landed\nproprietors is but a handful in the nation, and every\nday becoming fewer and fewer. Their labourers remain\nat the old 9s. or 10s. a week. Somebody will write to\nthe papers to-morrow and say they get 125., but bear in\nmind that they don't always receive wages on wet days;\nand I believe that the average money income of the\nagricultural labourer throughout the United Kingdom\nwill not exceed\u2014and many persons will say it will\nnot reach-10s. per week. The smaller in number\nthese landed proprietors become, the more it may\nbe these labourers become discontented, there may\narise some political accidents and political acci-\ndents come almost as unlooked-for as other accidents.\nThere may come a time when there will be a movement\ninthis country to establish not what I believe to be the\njust, moderate, and sufficient plan which I recommend;\nbut a plan which shall be in accordance with that which France, and\nis established by the Code Napoleon in\nwhich is spreading rapidly over the whole continent of\nEurope. I would ask again, how do they propose to\nkeep their population, if this system is to be maintained?\nDuring the past year 150,000 or 160,000 persons have\nsailed from this country to New York. In America\nthere are at this moment 140 millions of acres of land set\napart for those who are ready to settle upon them. In\nthe year 1861 there were not less than forty thousand\nnew farms over eighty acres each occupied in the Western\nS4tes ; but the Government of the United States, not\ncontent with that measure of progress, passed \"The\nHomesteads' Act,' which says that any man or woman\nof twenty-one years of age, or younger, if the\nman happened to have been for a fortnight or month\nin the service of the United States, whether in\nthe army or navy, may go into these territories and\nmay choose \"a section,\" which is one hundred and sixty\nacres of hind, and on paymentof a fee of 10 dols.,\nhe\nmay apply and have this land conveyed to him for no\nother payment for five years. It cannot be alienated.\nHe is notallowed to sell it. It remains in his posses-\nsion and, at the end of five years, he having done to it\n'Mint the Government requires, that is, settled upon it,\nand began cultivation, and so forth, then the law gives\nhim what is called a patent, what we call a parliamentary\ntitle. Then the land is absolute freehold for ever. Now\nwhen a man looks upon those children that make in\nthe poorest house sometimes a gleam of joy; when he\nthinks what these boys and girls:musfibe in this country,\nnever to rise one step higher than that which he occupies\nnow as an agricultural labourer; and when he looks\nabroad, and he sees them freeholders and landowners,\nand farmers of their own property\u2014then I say that\nthe temptation held out to men here to emigrate, if we\nknew all the facts would be irresistible to hundreds and\nthousands who have now no thought of moving to\nanother country\u2014even the agricultural labourer, as he\nonce was in some respects. There are some feeble\nefforts made to give him a little instruction. The\nUnited States offer social equality, political equality.\nI ask you if I am wrong in saying to the rich and to\nthe great that I believe, if they knew their own interest,\nit would be worth their while to try to make this\ncountry a more desirable one for the poor to live in. If\nthey disregard this great question, we who are of the\nmiddle class, or not absolutely powerless class, shall have\nto decide between the claims of territorial magnates,\nand the just rights of millions of our countrymen.\nDon't suppose, because I stand here, I love more to find\nfault with the laws of my country than to praise them.\nI want our country to be populous, to be powerful, and\nto be happy; but this end can only be attained\u2014and\never has been attained in any country\u2014but by just laws.\n","786013":"f\n0)1 if' tt\n, , ,s 4\n\nSATURDAY, JANUARY 24, 1863.\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nThe death of the Pacha of Egypt, in his\nforty first year, has caused excitement in\ndiplomatic circles during the present week.\nThe liacha had long suffered under disease,\nyet this event was not anticipated. According\nto the arrangements for the succession, he is\nfollowed in the Pachalic by Ismail, a son of the\nlate Ibrahim, and grandsonS of Mahomet Ali.\nThe death of Said Pacha may change the polio),\nof Egypt. During his reign it has been liberal,\nand yet administered under French influence.\nLouis Napoleon, in a letter to the general of\nhis army in Mexico, avows his purpose to be\nthe establishment of a Mexican monarchy, to\narrest the progress of the Anglo-Saxon race\nsouthward, and to secure the ascendancy of\n\"the Latin race,\" a figment invented for his\npurposes on part of the American continent.\nThis declaration some time ago would have\nroused the wrath of the -Union, and brought '\naid to Mexico from the North; but the Con-\nfederates and the Federals are now alike\nhelpless, and the latter are engaged in raising\nMexicans in the north of that country for the\ninvasion of Texas.\n\nThe battle at Fredericksburgh begins only\nnow to be undei stood. For some time the\nlosses on the Federal side seemed inadequate\nto explain the excitement caused by the dis-\naster among them. Their army numbered\nninety thousand men, and the loss of one-\nninth in killed and wounded, although a large\nproportion, would not fully explain the depres-\nsion caused by this failure in the North. The\ndate of the battle made it the last move for\nRichmond in the season. The expectations\nformed from a new general, with a sterner\npolicy than his predecessor, were rudely\nscattered. Rumour probably exaggerated the\nactual losses sustained; the figures officially\npublished have underrated them. Perhaps the\napparent discrepancy may be explained by the\ndispersion of survivors. A British officer who\nseems to have been present estimates the\nkilled and wounded Federals at 15,000, but\nhe adds 25,000 men in addition had disap-\npeared. He asserts that the fighting was\nchiefly done, and the loss mainly sustained by\nthe Irish Brigade. An officer in that brigade\nwrites that on the day after the battle, four of\nits regiments mustered only 36 officers and\n223 men! The battle had been disastrous to\nthe Irish.\n\nAt Murfreesboro the Federals after five days\nof fighting remained in possession of the town,\nwhich had been frequently captured and re-\ncaptured, but the Confederates retreated with\n28 pieces of captured cannon and 4,000 pri-\nsoners. the loss of life is described as terrible.\nThe Federals alone had 19 Colonels killed or\nwounded; and the loss of men is proportion-\nately severe. The result of the combats at\nVicksburgh at the same dates- is not clearly\nknown, but the fate of that stronghold may\nhave been decided before the despatch of the\nCanard Steamer, which may be expected during\nthe day.\n\nFive- to six millions sterling in notes form\nthe arrears due to the Federal army. They are\nto be paid in documents worth a third under\npar. The loan schemes now before Congress\nsum up to close on three hundred millions ster-\nling. But they cannot all be used even if all\nbe voted. A limit must exist to borrowing in\nthe money market, and we suppose it to be\nnearly reached.\n\nItaly is deficient in forty millions sterling\nfor the budgets of 1863 and 1864, and will\nborrow half of the sum, not objecting to the\nwhole if it could be obtained during the present\nyear.\n\nThe Duke of Saxe-Cobourg is likely to accept\nGreece, and the Greeks may take him as a\nmake-shift, knowing perhaps that Prince Alfred\nis his heir, will be Duke of Saxe-Cobourg, and\nonce in that position may act for himself in any\nfuture opening on the Greek throne.\nMany Meetings of members of parliament.\nwith their constituents, have occurred during\nthe last two weeks. Not a word of reform has\nbeen spoken at one of these. Mr. Bright and\nMn Scholefield were oltupied with interna-\ntional law. Mr. Baines explained Austrian\nimprovements. Mr. Milner Gibson advocated\nthe interests of the Federals. Mr. Hope was\nenthusiastic in favour of .the South. Mr,\nAyrton has a strong leaning that way. Lord\nFerraoy and Mr. H. Lewis hold with the\nNorth. The 'general opinion is favourable to I\ndoing nothing in the quarrel.\nA slight improvement is again noticed in\nthe cotton districts, but as not much over half\nthe quantity necessary can come from India in\n1863, and perhaps an equivalent\n.for a day's\nconsumption weekly from all other quarters, it\nwould be vain to expect the old quantity of\nwork in cotton before 1864.\n\nParliament reassembles in a few days, but\nthe coming session will pass as the last did,\nwith no advance in Reform, for the public are\neasily occupied with any foreign topic: and\nwhile they can be diverted from attention to\ntheir own business by remote incidents, they\nmay bie assured that it will be neglected.\n\nTHE EXTRAVAGANCE OF ECONOMY.\n. WE noticed in our last number the relation\nbetween the desire to save money and 'the\ndestruction of life; and stated the possibility\nof showing that saving often caused a great\nloss of property. Nothing is dearer than\nsaving in certain circumstances. A family try\nto save money on house rent, and pay twice\nthe economy out in doctor's bills and medicine.\nThe process is so common that, perhaps, a\nfalse economy is the greatest waste in, all the\nworld.\n\nNearly six weeks have passed since the _ex-\nplosion in the Edmund's Main coal pit. These\nweeks have been unproductive to the owners.\nThey have been spent in flooding the pit, and\nthat task being\n,now nearly accomplished,\ndouble the time will be required in pumping\nout the water. The expense and loss must\nreach to very many thousand pounds. They\nwill be equivalent to the price of a fine estate,\nall incurred for the purpose of saving the\ndifkrence between blasting by gunpowder and\nby hand labour. Similar practices exist in\nother although similar places. Gunpowder\nis employed in other pits, where it should\nnever be burned, or should never be seen; but\nall the money ever saved by its use, and much\nmore than all that money is probably lost in\nthis single explosion.\n\nThe Hartley pit calamity is fresh in all\nmemories. It would have been averted, or\ngreatly mitigated, by the existence of a supple-\nmentary communication, between the work-\nings or a second shaft. We know that\n\u00a370,000 was subscribed for the purpose of\nreplacing to the families of the lost men the\nvalue of their labour. A smaller sum was em-\nployed for that object, but it would be cruel\nmockery to suppose the.provision thus made\nby the public for survivors to be an equivalent\nfor the wages that would\u2022 have been earned\nI and employed in their behalf by their relatives,\nexcept for the catastrophe that cut their lives\nprematurely short. One hundred 'thousand\npounds would not be a high-pitched estimate\nof the loss sustained by the public from the\nwant of a second shaft at the Hartley coal pit;\nand the difference between the necessary out-\nlay and that large sum was lost by the desire to\nbe extremely economical. The loss to the re-\nlatives of the workmen formed, however, only\none item in a large account, and might not have\ninterfered with the means of the proprietors;\nbut it is obvious that a second shaft would\nhave been economy to them. They might by\nits aid have overcome the inundation of their\npit, and have saved from destruction property\nof great value.\n_ _ _ _\n\nrihe same facts exist in every trade. Half\nthe ships wrecked on our shores are said to\nperish from inadequate material, or from being\nunder-manned or weak handed. Economy of a\nfew shillings per cwt. on iron cables has often\ncost to insurers or owners as many thousand\npounds. In losses by fire or wreck we frequently\nread that the property was insured. Such in-\nformation is so common that readers appear to\nbelieve, when pro.perty is insured, that nothing\nhas been lost. Loss is not reduced by insur-\nance, but only transferred from one party to a\nnumber of persons. Some men say that half\nthe vessels lost annually are wrecked on account\nof marine insurance. They are ndi, bad hearted\nenough to suppose that the wrecks occur pur-\nposely and from sheer wickedness but what\nthey say leaves the blame with the practice\nrather than the practitioners of marine insur-\nance. This statement amounts to no more\nthan this\u2014that owners put ships to sea in a\ncondition which would be iniproved if the risk\nrested exclusively on themselves, and were not\ntaken chiefly by the insurers; but this state-\nment is sufficiently bad, and requires some in-\nquiry into its truth, and if it be found true,\ncalls for legislative surveillance over the ship-\nping interest.\n\nThe truth of the statement has never been\ndisputed on adequate authority, and no prac-\nti cal seaman entertains any 'doubt of it; yet\nthe nation continues in the old course allow-\ning not only the destruction of life, but even\nof an extravagant amount of property. An\ninquiry into the cause of accidents in any\nother profession will bring out the same result.\nIn building, in manufactories, in mechanical\nshops, we generally ind the rage for economy\nis the cause of accidents. The boiler of an '\nengine bursts, and single explosion destroys\nmore property than the worth of a dozen or a ,\nscore of !new boilers, or the cost of proper I\nsupervision for a century. The great railway\naccidents in the neighbourhood of London in\n1861 arose from the employment or over-\nworking of badly-paid men in positions of\ntrust, and they cost more money to the share-\nholders than they will save by shabby economy,\nlow wages, and over\u2014time and over-work to\nthe close of this century. The great accident\nof 1862 on the Edinburgh and Glasgow rail-\nway so clearly originated in an extravagant\neconomy, that even the manager of the com-\npany has been committed to take his trial for\nthe offence by the legal officials. He may be\nperfectly innocent, but an idea must . exist\nthat proper measures were not adopted to\nsecure the safe conveyance of the passengers,\nwhile the company in saving five pounds lost\nfifty thousand pounds on that day.\n","128273":"A GENERAL FAMILY NE\nTHE RECOGNISED ORGAN OF INDUSTRIAL INTERESTS.\n\nMST.A.l3l.4lsilmr) 1861.\n\nSINGULAR ACTION AND JUDGMENT.\nA judgment of interest to foreign families of which\nmembers have contracted matrimonial alliances in\nFrance was given a few days back in the Civil Court\nof Paris. The facts of the case were these :\u2014M. de\nBrimont married, about two years ago, a daughter of\nMr. and Mrs. Penniman, American subjects. No con-\ntract was drawn up, but the parents of the lady pro-\nmised verbally, according to M. de Brimont, to make\nthe young couple an annual allowance of 50,000 francs,\nas a marriage portion. The young wife died a few\nmonths back leaving an infant daughter, and Mr.\nPenniman, who until then had paid regularly the\nmoney, refused to continue it to the son-in-law. The\nlast named now brought a suit to enforce the continu-\nance of the payment, as alimony for himself and\ndaughter. The parents of the deceased lady, while\noffering to bring up the child, resisted the demand on\nthe grounds that the plaintiff was a spendthrift, and\nhe had concealed numerous debts when he married,\nand had since contracted new ones, and moreover that\nhe was young, and might by his labour procure for\nhimself sufficient resources. The tribunal, however,\ndecided that, as de Brimont was without means of ex-\nistence, and that as his own mother was not in a posi-\ntion of fortune to assist her son and granddaughter,\nthe plaintiff had a right to an alimentary pension\nfrom his wife's parents; and consequently condemned\nthem to pay an annual sum of 18,000 francs-6,000\nfrancs for M. de Brimont and 12,000 francs for his in-\nfant daughter.\n\nA CABMAN'S IMAGINARY LICENSE.\u2014At Southwark\nPolice-court, on the 3rd inst., Edward Warden, a cab-\ndriver, appeared to answer a complaint taken out\nagainst him by the authorities of the South-Eastern\nRailway for refusing to quit their premises when re-\nquested. Prisoner, in defence, said it was \"Foresters'\nday\" at the Palace and he wanted to get a job. Mr.\nPartridge said the defendant had not only defied the\nofficials of the company, but had tried to drive over\none of them, and also made use of bad language. If\ncabmen were allowed to do such things there would be\nan end to all order. This was a bad case, and the de-\nfendant must pay the full penalty of \u00a32, and 2s. costs.\nCONSUMPTION OF HORSE FLESH IN FRANCE.\u2014The\nreport of the Society for the Propagation of the Use of\nHorse Flesh as an article of Food, says :\u2014ln 1867 the\nshambles for horse flesh supplied for consumption in\nParis 2,152 horses (which number includes some\ndonkeys and mules), representing a nett weight of about\n430,400 kilogrammes. In 1868 it sold 484,200 kilo-\ngrammes in weight, being the flesh of 2,421 horses\u2014\nan increase of 269 horses, or 53,800 kilogrammes. Last\nwinter new shambles were established at Rheims,\nTroyes, Toulon, Marseilles, Sedan, Bordeaux, &c. The\nPrefect of the Guard, by a decree dated the 18th of\nJune, authorised the construction of a special slaughter-\nhouse for horses.\nFEMALE BEAUTY.\u2014M. Bonomi has been measuring\nthe Venus de Medici. He finds that, allowance being\nmade for her position, her height is about Sit. 2in.\n(Five feet two inches is considered below the middle\nheight, but painters and sculptors give it as the ideal\nheight in such poetic embodiments as those of their\nTitanias, Undines, Unas, Theklas, Perditas, Mignons,\nOphelias, and all those characters in which spiritual\nperfection is refined and tender rather than sensuously\npassionate, and inspiring more than sharing what are\ncalled strong feelings of the physical kind.) In the\nstatue of the Venus the foot is exactly nine inch es\nlong, rather more than one seventh of the whole\nheight. This does not quite agree with Vitruvius, who\ngives 1-6th of the height as the proper length of the\nfoot. The greatest width of this Venus's foot is\nthat is 1-18th of the height. Here then, says Bonomi,\nwe have a rule for shoemakers and shoe wearers. Any\nlady who compresses her foot below these dimensions\nis not only giving herself pain, but is putting herself\n\"out of proportion.\" All compression is as imperfect\nas all over-abundant exuberance; and painters in their\ndelineation of the female form are apt to indulge in the\nextremity of an embonpoint, as it is called, which only\nHottentots would desire in the proportions of their\nVenuses.\nALLEGED GREAT FINANCIAL BLUNDER.\u2014The India\npapers state that a rumour is widely spread that a\nblunder of great magnitude has been discovered in\nthe last Indian Budget, and that it is this that has\nstimulated the zeal of the Government of India on\nbehalf of economy to so extraordinary a pitch. We\ndo not know,\" says the Madras Times, \"what amount\nof truth may be in the report, but certain it is that\nthe vigorous, we might almost say desperate, use the\nSupreme Government is making of the pruning knife\naccords well enough with the statement that that Go-\nvernment finds itself poorer by two millions than it\nsupposed itself to be when the Budget was unfolded.\"\nPLUNDERING A MINISTER.\u2014M.

His female servant, whom he had\nbrought with him from Brussels, had also disappeared ;\nbut the police having been informed of the robbery,\nlearned that the woman's sweetheart had arrived in the\ntown that morning, and that two persons, answering\nthe description of the cook and her lover, had left in a\ncab for Nieuport.

Ac.idents on a great scale do not ex-\ncite so much sensation in America as in England,\nowing to the area of the country, the varieties of risk,\nand greater recklcssness of temperament. With\nthousands on thousands of miles of river navigation, in\nwild, half-deserted territory, careful inspection or care-\nful management is impossible; elaborate precautions\nwould be costly, if not impossible; people, therefore,\nmake up their minds to accidents. Much the same\nmay be said of railrcads. The alternative has been a\ngreat number of cheaply and hastily constructed roads,\nworked at low fares, or a very few expensive and care-\nfully managed lines for short distances. People chose\nthe former, and when casualties come bear them as\nsoldiers bear the losses of a victory. With mining\naccidents the people are less familiar, no mines reach\nthe depth of the English mines ; but there is no Govern-\nment inspection, and no legally enforced precautions\nare taken. The late accident occurred in a mine with\nbut one shaft, and round the mouth of the shaft there\nwas a large pile of wcoden buildings, containing stores,\nhoisting machinery, and so on, dry as tinder under the\nlong drought.

When the negotiations, however,\ncame before the United States Senate, they neither\nratified nor rejected, nor even debated them ; they\nsimply took no notice of them. In these circumstances\nthe two Governments prolonged the time within which\nthe treaty might be ratified, to the 15th of October, 1869.\nWithin a fortnight this prolonged period will have\nlapsed, without any action having been taken in the\nmatter by the American Senate. There is much specu-\nlation as to what President Grant's administration will\ndo.

Premises can now be represented\nby four cr more householders, and officers of health are\nto report, and when required, the owners\n.are to improve\nthe dwellings or to demolish the same. Where ex-\npenses are incurred a charge is to be given on the\nproperty, in the shape of a mortgage, and an annual\nsum to be paid. Where a local authority executes the\nworks, money may be borrowed of the Public Loan'\nCommissioners and others, and a \"charging order\"\nmade on the property. The text of the new law is to\nmake provision for taking down or improving dwellings\noccupied by working men and their families which are\nunfit for human habitation, and for the building and\n'maintaining of better dwellings.

This death brought to a close a career which\nhad been throughout one of high distinction. Born in\n1798, he took a first class in classics at Oxford ill 1820,\nand was initiated into official life. He was a Lord of\nthe Admiralty from 1832 to 1834, Vice-President of\nthe Board of Trade from 1835 to 1839, then for a short\ntime Under-Secretary of the Colonies, and then, re-\nturning to his former office, but with augmented rank,.\nPresident of the Board of Trade from 1839 to 1841.\nHe was, as he reminded the House in his last\nconsiderable speech, Chief Secretary for Ireland\nfrom July, 1846, to July, 1847, including, there-\nfore, a large portion of the famine period, and on\nleaving Ireland he resumed once more his old place\nat the Board of Trade, which he filled from 1847 until\n1852, during which time he took a leading part in the\nrepeal of the Navigation Laws. In 1855 he became\nSecretary of State for the Colonies, which office he held.\nuntil 1858, and in the following year he was raised to\nthe Peerage as Lord Taunton, a title which he assumed\nin compliment to the borough he had represented for\nnearly thirty years. Before entering Parliament he\ntravelled in the United States and in Canada with Lord\nDerby and the present Speaker of the House of Com-\nmons, and both by material interests and by sympathy\nhe was largely connected with America. By his first\nwife, a daughter of Sir Thomas Baring, and sister of\nMr. Thomas Baring, MX., who also died suddenly in\n1850, he had several daughters, one of whom is married\nto Captain Ellis, Equerry of the Prince of Wales. Lord\nT i\nTaunton subsequently married, n 1852, Lady Mary\nHoward, daughter of the sixth Earl of Carlisle, who\nsurvives him. Lord Taunton's last public employment\nwas as Chairman of the Endowed Schools Commiesion ;\nbut in whatever capacity he appeared he increased the\nreputation he had early gained as a scholar, as a gen.\ntleman, and as a zealous and able servant of the public.\n\nIMPORTANT QUESTION OF RAILWAY COMPENSATION.\n\u2014The case of the Hammersmith and City Railway\nCompany v. G. A. Brand and Mary Christiana Loaisa\n(his wife) was decided. This was a question whether\ncompensation could be claimed by the present defen-\ndants in respect of damage done to the value of a house\nsince the opening of t`.e above railway, by the vibration\nand smoke caused by the trains. The Court of Queen's\nBench decided that no compensation could be claimed,\nbecause the running of trains was a legalised use Jf ,ne\nline. The Exchequer Chamber reversed this decision.\nOn Tuesday the House of Lords set aside this reversal,\naffirming the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench.\nFATAL COLLIERY ACCIDENT.\u2014A lamentable accident\noccurred on Tuesday morning at the Alexandra Col-\ntahend ab-\nsenceaT\nlossieryo,\nfStuwt too n\nlives,,itra\nnSdt .\nseriousifelen injury\ns whi cht\no resultedthree\netrhse,\nwho were working in the Russ.ia Park mine of the pit.\ntaken repair,o f\nSome of the theroaddsayi,nadt\n,aXtlag\nwanted\nt\ne was\nthe men from the pit to repair and\nit esdoaty\nmany waspoafy\nprop up the roof.

The public\ntraitors are much more numerous than the shareholders\nin public companies, and neither their persons nor\naddresses are known to the Bank in the same way as the\nlatter are to the companies. .The bank system includes\natwofold protection\u2014first, from the stockholder having\nto take the initiative by making a claim; and second,\nfrom every claim being at once tested before the warrant\nis given up or payment made. If sent through the post\nthe warrants might go to the wrong address, or get into\nthe hands of the wrong parties, especially as deaths and\nchanges of address would be continually occurring.\nThe present system, moreover, is especially convenient\nto the bankers, through whom. the greater part of the\nmoney is pAd,\nfor those the ' warrants paid by the Bank of-\n&gland in cash being 40 per cent. of the whole dividend\nPai;(l.

Dr. Lankester, the coroner for\nCentral Middlesex, held an. inquest relative to the\ndeath of William Emery, infant son of a ham and\ntongue\n.41ea1er, of Great Portland-street, Marylebone,\nwho VMS alleged to have died through the introduc-\ntion of impure matter into the system in the opera;\ntion of vaccination. The inquest was held at the\nBrookfield Arms Tavern, Highgate Nevi-town. The\ninquiry resulted from one held a few days ago by\nMr. Bedford, the coroner for Westminster, in which\nthe same allegation was made, both children being\nvaccinated at Dr. Allen's surgery, 11, Soho-square.\nThe verdict Of the jury in the case before Mr. Bedford\nwas one of death from natural causes, Dr. Clark\nstating that the death was due to erysipelas consequent\non vaccination, not from the vaccine matter, but from\nthe punctures in the arm, the vaccine not taking effect.\nMr. Emery was present at that inquest, and, having\nlost his child from the same cause, pressed for an in-\nquiry. His child was buried at Highgate Cemetery,\nbut in conformity with the wishes of the father the\nbody was eihumed, and the present inquiry held. Mr.\nLewis, sen., attended on the part of the father of\nthe deceased; and Mr. Mirams represented Dr. Allen.\nMr. Aaron Emery, father of tho deceased, identified\nthe body as that of his son, who was vaccinated at Dr.\nAllen's establishment on the 31st of May, being then\neleven weeks old. Four wounds were made in the\nright arm, one af which appeared to be very deep. and\nbled very much. On the 7th June the child was taken\nback, the four vesicles haying taken, and two of them\nwere opened,-and some of the matter introduced into\nthe arm of another child. Two days after symptoms\nof a dang6rons character set in, principally proceeding\nfrom the largest wound, whence the matter had not\nbeen taken. The inflammation spread all over the\narm, which swelled to double its usual size. Dr. Allen\nand his assistant attended, and the swelling decreased\nin the arm, but went into the body, back, legs, and\nscrotum. From the 9th cb.y of June till its death on\nthe 4th July, the child appeared to be conscious. It\nonly dozed, and started up s'Arieking with agony. Mr.\nThomas Massey Harding, F.R.C.S., said he had been\na public vaccinator for more than twelve years. He\nhad made a post-mortem examination of the deceased,\nand found, notwithstanding its illness, that it was a\nvery fine, well-nourished child. The immediate cause\nof death was exhaustion from erysipelas produced by\nthe vaccination\u2014he thought by the cow-pox virus\nbeing introduced into the wounds. He had vaccinated\nfrom 4,000 to 5,000 children,, and he had never had a\ndeath. His brother, and Dr. Ballard, of Islington, had\nalso vaccinated some thousands, and they had only had\none death each. If erysipelas set in after vaccination\nhe might not know of it, as parents would take their\nchildren to their own doctors. An unclean lancet or\nother instrument used for making the exeoriations for\nthe reception of the lymph might produce erysipelas.\nHe had seen the child from which deoeased had been\nvaccinated, and it was perfectly healthy, as were also the\nfather and mother. The jury ultimately returned a\nverdict of Died from Erysipelas, caused by vaccination.\n\n\" Where did you get that turkey P\" said a colonel to\none of his amiable rectuits, who eatne. into camp the\noti er day with a fine bird. \" Stole it,\" was the laconic\nreply. \"Ah !\" said the colonel, triumphantly, to 's\nbystander,\" you see my boys may steal, but they won't\n\nA MEETING OF THE SAINTS AT ..119.\/kT PAULO.-1\nthought processions were over for the present, but\nlast evening there was one of some magnitude, con-\nveying a saint from one church to another, and\nspite of wet streets after heavy rain, a large num-\nber of people turned out to witness and follow the\nparticipants in the ceremony. To-day, however, it\nbeing Friday the 6th of March, was set apart for a\nspecial occasion\u2014a meeting, not a race of saints;\nand, for a wonder, the day and night have been re-\nmarkably fine, a beautiful bright moon now shining\nafter the great bustle is over and the saints gone to\nrest, though the illuminated altars in various parts\nof the city are still glittering in all their tinsel, with\nnumerous worshippers, after depositing in the plate\ntheir offerings in the shape of \"dumps,\" a slang\nphrase for copper coins. Preparatory symptoms\nhave been going on for some days at a sort of large\ncloset, or \"hole in the wall\" of the house opposite,\nbelonging to an old nobleman, whose wife departed\nthis life to-day. The folding doors had been opened\nand a large blue cloth thrown over the sanctuary\nfrom a balcony above, but still it was easy to see\nthat something unusual was in progress; and to-\nday, at about the time of the procession, the door\nopened, and the curtain was withdrawn, revealing\na very pretty altar, with a cross and small figures\nof saints at the top, the back parts and sides being\ncovered with gold and silver tinsel, and groups or\ngarlands of artificial flowers tastefully arranged,\nthe whole lighted up by an immense number of\ncandles, many of them in silver candlesticks, pro-\nvided or lent for the occasion by devotees. There\nwere about a dozen or more of these old cupboard\naltars decked out, each apparently vying for supre-\nmacy in effect. But lam forgetting the procession\nitself, which began to form at five o'clock, accom-\npanied by the usual paraphernalia\u2014a number of\nyoung girls dressed up as angels, bands of music,\nsoldiers with fixed bayonets, the President of the\nProvince, and all the dignitaries, with the high\npriest under a canopy and his attendants as before,\nwhilst in front and behind walked the multitude.\nThe meeting of the saints took place close to the\nhotel, where a halt was made, and a stout eccle-\nsiastic (the bishop's secretary, I believe), for whom\na very large pulpit had been temporarily erected at\nthe corner of four streets, addressed a very ener-\ngetic discourse to the multitude, until his voice\nbegan to get rather squeaky, nor could very much\nbe made of what he said beyond that his listeners\nwere a very bad lot, and required all the interven-\ntion of the saints before them to save them from\nperdition. The sermon ended, some music and sing-\ning took place before the altar opposite to our hotel,\nafter which the procession went on, passing all the\nstreet altars, and this part of the ceremony ended\nwhen the saints were all fairly housed. For hours,\nhowever, before the bright gaudy altars, and the\nstill brighter moon, the whole ponulation of the\nplace passed in review, making their reverence and\ndepositing their \"dumps\" or offertories.\u2014Drazil\nand the River Plate in 1868, by W. Hadfield.\nFIRST ESCAPE FROM THE TOWEIL\u2014The first of-\nfender ever lodged within its walls contrived to es-\ncape from his guards to let himself down from a\nwindow, and to slip through the postern to his boat.\nThis bold offender was that Ralph of Durham, called\nthe Firebrand and the Lion, who for many years\nhad been the treasurer and justiciar to the Norman\nkings. On the death of Rufus he was seized by the\nCommons until the new king's pleasure should be\nknown about him \u2022 and Henry the Scholar, who had\ngood deeds rather'than good rights to befriend him\nin his contest with Robert for the crown, sent the\nunpopular prelate to the tower. Henry was not in-\nclined to harshness; and Ralph, though lodged in\nthe keep which he had helped to build, was treated\nlike a guest. He lived in the upper rooms, on the\ntier now known as the banqueting-floor ; his rooms\nhaving plenty of space and light, a good fireplace,\na private closet, and free access to St. John's chapel.\nWilliam de Mandeville, Constable of the Tower, was\nappointed his keeper, and two shillings a day were\npaid from the King's exchequer for his diet. He\nwas suffered to have his own servants and chaplains\nin his rooms, and to send out for such wines and\n'meats as his stomach craved and his purse could buy.\nOne of the richest men in England, he could buy\na good deal; one of the cleverest men in England, he\ncould scheme a long way. But before resorting to his\nmoney and his wits in self-defence, Ralph tried how\nfar he could reckon on the virtues of the pastoral\nstaff. A bishop was not only a baron of the realm,\nsiing as\nthis ju\ngdrgonen;\nbut a prince of the universal Church. No doubt he\nhad exercised lay functions, acting as a financier,\nwhom the se-ular laws were held to have no binding\nforce. On hi\no a\nLord Prim dblinet 'asptiplel\nalheed wthasAan\nsperiimes,t,thoenn\nPrimate, as to his brother and his chief.

The stout Norman 'knights who kept guard\nin his chamber were jolly fellows, fond of good cheer\nand lusty at a song. On this weakness he began to\nplay. Sending for good wine, and giving orders to\nhis cook, he invited to his table a belt of boisterous\nknights. When the folks looked up at the keep, in\nwhich their enemy was caged, they saw lights in\nthe windows rather late, and haply went to bed, in\nthe pious hope that their bad bishop was going\nquickly to his proper doom. At length his scheme was\nripe. Asking the knights to supper he sent out for\njars of wine; a potent liquor which, in due time,\nlaid those warriors asleep on bench and floor. The\ntime was winter (the date February, 1101), the night\ncame down quickly on the Tower. When the guards\nwere all drunk, the sober bishop rose from his table,\ndrew a long coil of rope from one of the jars, passed\ninto the South room, tied his cord to the window'\nshaft, and taking his crozier with him, let himself\nrpautth et\nrr\nosshtoyr ts,e\nravnado\nths o\nwhofell\ndown.

Majesty's Tower\n\nATTEMPT TO RESCUE A DESLI:I=Z FROM\n\nTUE PoiALE\u2018\n\nCornelius Carle'on, a man of gentlemanly appear-\nance, a civil engin er, staying at\u2022 the Basinglaall\nHotel, was chargad at Bow-street, on the 17th inst.,\nwith assaulting Police constab.e \u2022 H`Queen and at-\ntempting to rescue a prisoner named Thomas William\nClifford from the custody cl that officer. The officer,\n3.l`Queen, said Clifford was a deserter from H.M.S.\nCornwallis at Plymouth, and was comraitLed from\nWandsworth that afternoon, and Groves, anoiher\npoliceman, was instructed to take him to Woolwich.\nGroves was in unform. As Clifford was violent, wit-\nness, who was in private clothes, was instructed to\naccompany and assist Groves. As they were convey-\ning the deserter from Northumberland House the pri-\nsoner rushed up and seized witness by the throat, ex-\nclaiming, \"What are you going to do with this\nman ?\" The prisoner, from the commencement of the\ncase, exhibited great excitement, agitation, and con-\nfusion, and Sir Thomas Henry was obliged to check\nhim. The witness went on to say that the prisoner\nattempted to rescue the deserter, and -called upon the\nby-standers to assist, addressing them as \"brothers,\"\nand demanding whether they would allow a fellow-\ncreature, innocent of any crime, to be dragged away\nto a dungeon? Clifford, encouraged by this attempt\nto rescue him, tried desperately to get away, and\nseverely wounded Grove's face with his handcuffs.\nUltimately Carleton was given in custody. . The\nofficer Groves, and another witness, an accidental\npasser-by, corroborated. The prisoner said he had\nonly done his duty, as England expected of every\nman, and as Lord Nelson had done. It would be his\nduty to interfere if a man was about to be shot in the\nstreet. It was well known that in the present critical\nstate of politics in England the police were in the\nconstant habit of arresting persons, and instead of\ndetaining them, or preferring any charge against\nthem, the officers privately assassinated them. Sir\nThomas Henry\u2014How could you know that he was\nnot in lawful custody under a Warrant? The pri-\nsoner\u2014Let me see the warrant. Sir Thomas Henry\u2014\nI have objection. The prisoner, after reading the\nwarrant, declared, in a patronising manner, that it\nWas \"quite correct.\" Sir Thomas Henry\u2014Then you\nsee you were in the wrong? The prisoner\u2014Oh, dear,\nno. Sir Thomas Henry said he must remand him.\nPrisoner\u2014Remand me! lam a man now. Sir\nThomas Henry\u2014l shall have you put back till the\n26th inst. The prisoner\u2014Oh! detain me. I thought\nYOU were joking. Sir Thomas Henry\u2014Remand is the\nusual term. After the prisoner's removal, Sir Thomas\nHenry observed that it would have been better not to\nhave brought a desperate man, handcuffed, through\nthe streets in open day from Victoria-to Charing-cross.\n\nWOUNDING WITH INTENT TO MURDER.\nThomas Connel, a respectable-looking man, was\nindicted at the Central Criminal Court AI the 16th\ninst.' for feloniously wounding Mary Ann Beckett,\nWith intent to murder her. In a second count it was\nalleged that he intended to do her grievous bodily\nharm. Mr. Brindley prosecuted. The prisoner had\nbeen living with the prosecutrix, a widow, and on the\nnight of the 4th of May they went to bed together.\nDuring the night the prisoner got up and cut her throat\nwith a knife' inflicting a very dangerous wound. She\nthen ran out, and was taken to the hospital, were she\nreceived immediate medical attention, and she had\nsince recovered from the injuries that had been inflicted\nUpon her. The prisoner also cut his own throat, but\nhad since recovered. It appeared that there had been\na quarrel between them, in consequence of the prisoner\nhaving found the prosecutrix in bed with another man\non the previous Friday. The prisoner's father and\nbrother were called, and stated that he had been in the\narmy ten years, and received his discharge in 1868.\nSince then he had occasionally been employed as a\nprinter. His mother and aunt had been insane, and\nhis own mind had become affected since his return\nfrom India with his regiment, where he had suffered\nfrom sunstroke. Mr. Jonas, the governor of Newo-ate,\nstated that he had had the prisoner under his charge\nfor four or five weeks, and had observed nothing in\nhis conduct that would lead him to suppose him of un-\nsound mind. The prisoner addressing the jury, said\nhe was sitting up cutting his tobacco, when the prose-\ncutrix kept pulling his shirt, and he, forgetting he had\na knife in his hand, made a \" hit \"at her. If he had\nhad any murderous intent he could have prevented her\nleaving the room. The jury found the prisoner guilty\non the second count, and recommended him to\nmercy. The learned judge commented upon the enor-\nmity of the crime he had committed and the serious\nconsequences that might have followed, and sentenced\nhim to five years' Penal servitude.\n","45957":"DEATH OF THE DEAN OF DURHAM.\n\nThe Very Rev.

His companion went to his aid, and found him\nclinging to a piece of rock that overhangs a precipice.\nHe gave Mr. Griffiths his handkerchief as a support\nuntil aid could be received, but the poor man could\nnot retain his hold many moments, and, letting go, he\nwas dashed on the rocks nearly twenty yards below.\nThe alarm was given in the town, and police-serjeant\nJones, with four boatmen, took a boat to the spot.\nThe body was found dreadfully mangled, and brought\nto the town.

Dr. Lankester, the coroner for\nCentral Middlesex, held an. inquest relative to the\ndeath of William Emery, infant son of a ham and\ntongue\n.41ea1er, of Great Portland-street, Marylebone,\nwho VMS alleged to have died through the introduc-\ntion of impure matter into the system in the opera;\ntion of vaccination. The inquest was held at the\nBrookfield Arms Tavern, Highgate Nevi-town. The\ninquiry resulted from one held a few days ago by\nMr. Bedford, the coroner for Westminster, in which\nthe same allegation was made, both children being\nvaccinated at Dr. Allen's surgery, 11, Soho-square.\nThe verdict Of the jury in the case before Mr. Bedford\nwas one of death from natural causes, Dr. Clark\nstating that the death was due to erysipelas consequent\non vaccination, not from the vaccine matter, but from\nthe punctures in the arm, the vaccine not taking effect.\nMr. Emery was present at that inquest, and, having\nlost his child from the same cause, pressed for an in-\nquiry. His child was buried at Highgate Cemetery,\nbut in conformity with the wishes of the father the\nbody was eihumed, and the present inquiry held. Mr.\nLewis, sen., attended on the part of the father of\nthe deceased; and Mr. Mirams represented Dr. Allen.\nMr. Aaron Emery, father of tho deceased, identified\nthe body as that of his son, who was vaccinated at Dr.\nAllen's establishment on the 31st of May, being then\neleven weeks old. Four wounds were made in the\nright arm, one af which appeared to be very deep. and\nbled very much. On the 7th June the child was taken\nback, the four vesicles haying taken, and two of them\nwere opened,-and some of the matter introduced into\nthe arm of another child. Two days after symptoms\nof a dang6rons character set in, principally proceeding\nfrom the largest wound, whence the matter had not\nbeen taken. The inflammation spread all over the\narm, which swelled to double its usual size. Dr. Allen\nand his assistant attended, and the swelling decreased\nin the arm, but went into the body, back, legs, and\nscrotum. From the 9th cb.y of June till its death on\nthe 4th July, the child appeared to be conscious. It\nonly dozed, and started up s'Arieking with agony. Mr.\nThomas Massey Harding, F.R.C.S., said he had been\na public vaccinator for more than twelve years. He\nhad made a post-mortem examination of the deceased,\nand found, notwithstanding its illness, that it was a\nvery fine, well-nourished child. The immediate cause\nof death was exhaustion from erysipelas produced by\nthe vaccination\u2014he thought by the cow-pox virus\nbeing introduced into the wounds. He had vaccinated\nfrom 4,000 to 5,000 children,, and he had never had a\ndeath. His brother, and Dr. Ballard, of Islington, had\nalso vaccinated some thousands, and they had only had\none death each. If erysipelas set in after vaccination\nhe might not know of it, as parents would take their\nchildren to their own doctors. An unclean lancet or\nother instrument used for making the exeoriations for\nthe reception of the lymph might produce erysipelas.\nHe had seen the child from which deoeased had been\nvaccinated, and it was perfectly healthy, as were also the\nfather and mother. The jury ultimately returned a\nverdict of Died from Erysipelas, caused by vaccination.\n\n\" Where did you get that turkey P\" said a colonel to\none of his amiable rectuits, who eatne. into camp the\noti er day with a fine bird. \" Stole it,\" was the laconic\nreply. \"Ah !\" said the colonel, triumphantly, to 's\nbystander,\" you see my boys may steal, but they won't\n\nA MEETING OF THE SAINTS AT ..119.\/kT PAULO.-1\nthought processions were over for the present, but\nlast evening there was one of some magnitude, con-\nveying a saint from one church to another, and\nspite of wet streets after heavy rain, a large num-\nber of people turned out to witness and follow the\nparticipants in the ceremony. To-day, however, it\nbeing Friday the 6th of March, was set apart for a\nspecial occasion\u2014a meeting, not a race of saints;\nand, for a wonder, the day and night have been re-\nmarkably fine, a beautiful bright moon now shining\nafter the great bustle is over and the saints gone to\nrest, though the illuminated altars in various parts\nof the city are still glittering in all their tinsel, with\nnumerous worshippers, after depositing in the plate\ntheir offerings in the shape of \"dumps,\" a slang\nphrase for copper coins. Preparatory symptoms\nhave been going on for some days at a sort of large\ncloset, or \"hole in the wall\" of the house opposite,\nbelonging to an old nobleman, whose wife departed\nthis life to-day. The folding doors had been opened\nand a large blue cloth thrown over the sanctuary\nfrom a balcony above, but still it was easy to see\nthat something unusual was in progress; and to-\nday, at about the time of the procession, the door\nopened, and the curtain was withdrawn, revealing\na very pretty altar, with a cross and small figures\nof saints at the top, the back parts and sides being\ncovered with gold and silver tinsel, and groups or\ngarlands of artificial flowers tastefully arranged,\nthe whole lighted up by an immense number of\ncandles, many of them in silver candlesticks, pro-\nvided or lent for the occasion by devotees. There\nwere about a dozen or more of these old cupboard\naltars decked out, each apparently vying for supre-\nmacy in effect. But lam forgetting the procession\nitself, which began to form at five o'clock, accom-\npanied by the usual paraphernalia\u2014a number of\nyoung girls dressed up as angels, bands of music,\nsoldiers with fixed bayonets, the President of the\nProvince, and all the dignitaries, with the high\npriest under a canopy and his attendants as before,\nwhilst in front and behind walked the multitude.\nThe meeting of the saints took place close to the\nhotel, where a halt was made, and a stout eccle-\nsiastic (the bishop's secretary, I believe), for whom\na very large pulpit had been temporarily erected at\nthe corner of four streets, addressed a very ener-\ngetic discourse to the multitude, until his voice\nbegan to get rather squeaky, nor could very much\nbe made of what he said beyond that his listeners\nwere a very bad lot, and required all the interven-\ntion of the saints before them to save them from\nperdition. The sermon ended, some music and sing-\ning took place before the altar opposite to our hotel,\nafter which the procession went on, passing all the\nstreet altars, and this part of the ceremony ended\nwhen the saints were all fairly housed. For hours,\nhowever, before the bright gaudy altars, and the\nstill brighter moon, the whole ponulation of the\nplace passed in review, making their reverence and\ndepositing their \"dumps\" or offertories.\u2014Drazil\nand the River Plate in 1868, by W. Hadfield.\nFIRST ESCAPE FROM THE TOWEIL\u2014The first of-\nfender ever lodged within its walls contrived to es-\ncape from his guards to let himself down from a\nwindow, and to slip through the postern to his boat.\nThis bold offender was that Ralph of Durham, called\nthe Firebrand and the Lion, who for many years\nhad been the treasurer and justiciar to the Norman\nkings. On the death of Rufus he was seized by the\nCommons until the new king's pleasure should be\nknown about him \u2022 and Henry the Scholar, who had\ngood deeds rather'than good rights to befriend him\nin his contest with Robert for the crown, sent the\nunpopular prelate to the tower. Henry was not in-\nclined to harshness; and Ralph, though lodged in\nthe keep which he had helped to build, was treated\nlike a guest. He lived in the upper rooms, on the\ntier now known as the banqueting-floor ; his rooms\nhaving plenty of space and light, a good fireplace,\na private closet, and free access to St. John's chapel.\nWilliam de Mandeville, Constable of the Tower, was\nappointed his keeper, and two shillings a day were\npaid from the King's exchequer for his diet. He\nwas suffered to have his own servants and chaplains\nin his rooms, and to send out for such wines and\n'meats as his stomach craved and his purse could buy.\nOne of the richest men in England, he could buy\na good deal; one of the cleverest men in England, he\ncould scheme a long way. But before resorting to his\nmoney and his wits in self-defence, Ralph tried how\nfar he could reckon on the virtues of the pastoral\nstaff. A bishop was not only a baron of the realm,\nsiing as\nthis ju\ngdrgonen;\nbut a prince of the universal Church. No doubt he\nhad exercised lay functions, acting as a financier,\nwhom the se-ular laws were held to have no binding\nforce.

The stout Norman 'knights who kept guard\nin his chamber were jolly fellows, fond of good cheer\nand lusty at a song. On this weakness he began to\nplay. Sending for good wine, and giving orders to\nhis cook, he invited to his table a belt of boisterous\nknights. When the folks looked up at the keep, in\nwhich their enemy was caged, they saw lights in\nthe windows rather late, and haply went to bed, in\nthe pious hope that their bad bishop was going\nquickly to his proper doom. At length his scheme was\nripe. Asking the knights to supper he sent out for\njars of wine; a potent liquor which, in due time,\nlaid those warriors asleep on bench and floor. The\ntime was winter (the date February, 1101), the night\ncame down quickly on the Tower. When the guards\nwere all drunk, the sober bishop rose from his table,\ndrew a long coil of rope from one of the jars, passed\ninto the South room, tied his cord to the window'\nshaft, and taking his crozier with him, let himself\nrpautth et\nrr\nosshtoyr ts,e\nravnado\nths o\nwhofell\ndown.

The officer,\n3.l`Queen, said Clifford was a deserter from H.M.S.\nCornwallis at Plymouth, and was comraitLed from\nWandsworth that afternoon, and Groves, anoiher\npoliceman, was instructed to take him to Woolwich.\nGroves was in unform. As Clifford was violent, wit-\nness, who was in private clothes, was instructed to\naccompany and assist Groves. As they were convey-\ning the deserter from Northumberland House the pri-\nsoner rushed up and seized witness by the throat, ex-\nclaiming, \"What are you going to do with this\nman ?\" The prisoner, from the commencement of the\ncase, exhibited great excitement, agitation, and con-\nfusion, and Sir Thomas Henry was obliged to check\nhim. The witness went on to say that the prisoner\nattempted to rescue the deserter, and -called upon the\nby-standers to assist, addressing them as \"brothers,\"\nand demanding whether they would allow a fellow-\ncreature, innocent of any crime, to be dragged away\nto a dungeon? Clifford, encouraged by this attempt\nto rescue him, tried desperately to get away, and\nseverely wounded Grove's face with his handcuffs.\nUltimately Carleton was given in custody. . The\nofficer Groves, and another witness, an accidental\npasser-by, corroborated. The prisoner said he had\nonly done his duty, as England expected of every\nman, and as Lord Nelson had done. It would be his\nduty to interfere if a man was about to be shot in the\nstreet. It was well known that in the present critical\nstate of politics in England the police were in the\nconstant habit of arresting persons, and instead of\ndetaining them, or preferring any charge against\nthem, the officers privately assassinated them. Sir\nThomas Henry\u2014How could you know that he was\nnot in lawful custody under a Warrant? The pri-\nsoner\u2014Let me see the warrant. Sir Thomas Henry\u2014\nI have objection. The prisoner, after reading the\nwarrant, declared, in a patronising manner, that it\nWas \"quite correct.\" Sir Thomas Henry\u2014Then you\nsee you were in the wrong? The prisoner\u2014Oh, dear,\nno. Sir Thomas Henry said he must remand him.\nPrisoner\u2014Remand me! lam a man now. Sir\nThomas Henry\u2014l shall have you put back till the\n26th inst. The prisoner\u2014Oh! detain me. I thought\nYOU were joking. Sir Thomas Henry\u2014Remand is the\nusual term. After the prisoner's removal, Sir Thomas\nHenry observed that it would have been better not to\nhave brought a desperate man, handcuffed, through\nthe streets in open day from Victoria-to Charing-cross.\n\nWOUNDING WITH INTENT TO MURDER.\nThomas Connel, a respectable-looking man, was\nindicted at the Central Criminal Court AI the 16th\ninst.' for feloniously wounding Mary Ann Beckett,\nWith intent to murder her. In a second count it was\nalleged that he intended to do her grievous bodily\nharm. Mr. Brindley prosecuted. The prisoner had\nbeen living with the prosecutrix, a widow, and on the\nnight of the 4th of May they went to bed together.\nDuring the night the prisoner got up and cut her throat\nwith a knife' inflicting a very dangerous wound. She\nthen ran out, and was taken to the hospital, were she\nreceived immediate medical attention, and she had\nsince recovered from the injuries that had been inflicted\nUpon her. The prisoner also cut his own throat, but\nhad since recovered. It appeared that there had been\na quarrel between them, in consequence of the prisoner\nhaving found the prosecutrix in bed with another man\non the previous Friday. The prisoner's father and\nbrother were called, and stated that he had been in the\narmy ten years, and received his discharge in 1868.\nSince then he had occasionally been employed as a\nprinter. His mother and aunt had been insane, and\nhis own mind had become affected since his return\nfrom India with his regiment, where he had suffered\nfrom sunstroke. Mr. Jonas, the governor of Newo-ate,\nstated that he had had the prisoner under his charge\nfor four or five weeks, and had observed nothing in\nhis conduct that would lead him to suppose him of un-\nsound mind. The prisoner addressing the jury, said\nhe was sitting up cutting his tobacco, when the prose-\ncutrix kept pulling his shirt, and he, forgetting he had\na knife in his hand, made a \" hit \"at her. If he had\nhad any murderous intent he could have prevented her\nleaving the room. The jury found the prisoner guilty\non the second count, and recommended him to\nmercy. The learned judge commented upon the enor-\nmity of the crime he had committed and the serious\nconsequences that might have followed, and sentenced\nhim to five years' Penal servitude.\n","128274":"A GENERAL FAMILY NE\nTHE RECOGNISED ORGAN OF INDUSTRIAL INTERESTS.\n\nMST.A.l3l.4lsilmr) 1861.\n\nSINGULAR ACTION AND JUDGMENT.\nA judgment of interest to foreign families of which\nmembers have contracted matrimonial alliances in\nFrance was given a few days back in the Civil Court\nof Paris. The facts of the case were these :\u2014M. de\nBrimont married, about two years ago, a daughter of\nMr. and Mrs. Penniman, American subjects. No con-\ntract was drawn up, but the parents of the lady pro-\nmised verbally, according to M. de Brimont, to make\nthe young couple an annual allowance of 50,000 francs,\nas a marriage portion. The young wife died a few\nmonths back leaving an infant daughter, and Mr.\nPenniman, who until then had paid regularly the\nmoney, refused to continue it to the son-in-law. The\nlast named now brought a suit to enforce the continu-\nance of the payment, as alimony for himself and\ndaughter. The parents of the deceased lady, while\noffering to bring up the child, resisted the demand on\nthe grounds that the plaintiff was a spendthrift, and\nhe had concealed numerous debts when he married,\nand had since contracted new ones, and moreover that\nhe was young, and might by his labour procure for\nhimself sufficient resources. The tribunal, however,\ndecided that, as de Brimont was without means of ex-\nistence, and that as his own mother was not in a posi-\ntion of fortune to assist her son and granddaughter,\nthe plaintiff had a right to an alimentary pension\nfrom his wife's parents; and consequently condemned\nthem to pay an annual sum of 18,000 francs-6,000\nfrancs for M. de Brimont and 12,000 francs for his in-\nfant daughter.\n\nA CABMAN'S IMAGINARY LICENSE.\u2014At Southwark\nPolice-court, on the 3rd inst., Edward Warden, a cab-\ndriver, appeared to answer a complaint taken out\nagainst him by the authorities of the South-Eastern\nRailway for refusing to quit their premises when re-\nquested. Prisoner, in defence, said it was \"Foresters'\nday\" at the Palace and he wanted to get a job. Mr.\nPartridge said the defendant had not only defied the\nofficials of the company, but had tried to drive over\none of them, and also made use of bad language.

Bonomi has been measuring\nthe Venus de Medici. He finds that, allowance being\nmade for her position, her height is about Sit. 2in.\n(Five feet two inches is considered below the middle\nheight, but painters and sculptors give it as the ideal\nheight in such poetic embodiments as those of their\nTitanias, Undines, Unas, Theklas, Perditas, Mignons,\nOphelias, and all those characters in which spiritual\nperfection is refined and tender rather than sensuously\npassionate, and inspiring more than sharing what are\ncalled strong feelings of the physical kind.) In the\nstatue of the Venus the foot is exactly nine inch es\nlong, rather more than one seventh of the whole\nheight. This does not quite agree with Vitruvius, who\ngives 1-6th of the height as the proper length of the\nfoot. The greatest width of this Venus's foot is\nthat is 1-18th of the height. Here then, says Bonomi,\nwe have a rule for shoemakers and shoe wearers. Any\nlady who compresses her foot below these dimensions\nis not only giving herself pain, but is putting herself\n\"out of proportion.\" All compression is as imperfect\nas all over-abundant exuberance; and painters in their\ndelineation of the female form are apt to indulge in the\nextremity of an embonpoint, as it is called, which only\nHottentots would desire in the proportions of their\nVenuses.\nALLEGED GREAT FINANCIAL BLUNDER.\u2014The India\npapers state that a rumour is widely spread that a\nblunder of great magnitude has been discovered in\nthe last Indian Budget, and that it is this that has\nstimulated the zeal of the Government of India on\nbehalf of economy to so extraordinary a pitch.

It seems that William Todd, aged 26, his brother Enfield Todd, aged about 20, and another bea,chmart, mimed Samuel E. Fleming, 20, proceeded out of the harbour in a new boat, tor \"the purpose of drawing for some smelts and other fish along the shore. Just as they reached tho bar, and precisely where the late life boat catastrophe took place, their small omit was caught by a sea and swamped. The men were thrown into the water, and being heavily attired, two of them sank and were drowmed ; while Enfield Todd manit,ged to extricate himself, and swam to the beach. The accident was observed from the north pier by some pilots, and they at once launched a boat and proceeded to the scene of the disaster, but too late to be of service. Subsequently the boat was picked up, and the body of the elder Todd was found entangled in the netting. The tide was low on the bar at the time ot the accident. Twenty-five beaehmen have been drowned in Yarmouth river since January last.","400564":"The object of this contrivance, which consists of a modification of the ordinary coupling, is to cut off the connection between the engine and carriages of a train whenever the engine runs off the rails, so as to prevent the rest of the train being dragged after it over em- bankments or bridges. The ordinary coupling consists of draw-bars,. hooks, and right and left handed screws' so as to bring the buffers of the carriages in a train close together. There are also safety chains, one on each side of the main coupling. The improvement comes into action the moment the engine or tender happens to diverge at a certain angle from the line of railway, the main coupling is then thrown out of gear and released from its hold, the spring bolts are driven back by the springs into the void left by the draw-bar being withdrawn, the safety chains are instantly +berated from the eyebolts on the frame of the carriage, and the engine or tender is thus com- pletely separated from thereat of the train. It appears that accidents from engines running off the rails amount to more than 20 per cent. of the total number of acci- dents to railway trains. From the Ist of July to the Ist of December' 1860, there were 13 accidents from this cause in the United Kingdom, by which 6 pas- sengers were killed and 43 injured. In the year 1861 there were 29 accidents of this kind, in which 24 pas- sengers were killed and 95 injured. In the year 1862 there were 28 accidents, in which 18 were killed and 282 injured; and in the year 1863 there were 21 acci- dents from engines.and trains running off lines of rail- way, which resulted in the death of 15, persons and injury to 161 persons, making together in the course of 3t years 90 accidents from engines and trains running off the rails, causing in the aggregate the death of 63 persons, and more or less serious injury to 443 persons, besides involving destruction of rolling stock and large surna for compensation. This indicates to some extent the advantage of adopting the system of coupling patented by Messrs. Kirkman and Moues, of Parlia- ment-street, and which appears to be very complete in every respect for the purpose intended. It is in course of being adopted on some of the passenger fast trains en the Great Eastern Railway, where accidents from that cause have heretofore been rather more frequent than on other railways A full-sized model of the apparatus can be seen at the offices in Parliament- street, which will enable those who are interested in preventing such accidents to judge for themselves. It is rather remarkable that the Government inspectors of railways have no power to require the adoption of any improvement that might appear to them calculatedito prevent accidents on railways open for traffic, although they have power to prevent the opening of a railway for traffic until all the requirements as to the stability of the works and the efficiency of the signals have been fully tested and approved by tfiem on behalf of the railway department of the Board of Trade.","403075":"The annual return from the Board of Trade concern- ing the railways of the United Kingdom has been issued. It exhibits in nearly every category an uniform increase for 1863 on the same statistics for 1862, whether it be in mileage, passenger traffic, goods traffic, or the several items of income and expenditure. The statistics are gigantic and of the greatest interest, and serve to illustrate with important truthfulness the immense results which are identified with the railway system of this country, and how these results spring from the necessities of our every-day life. Last year 173,605,485 passengers travelled on the railways in England and Wales, which, taking the population at something under 22,000,000 would give an aver- age of say eight journeys for each individual. From these returns we cull the following statistics of the railways in England and Wales. On the 31st of December, 1863, there were in all 8,568 miles of way open, over which 3,811,878 trains ran carrying 173,605, 485 passengers of all classes' exclusive of those who held season tickets, of whom there were 42,991. In connection with the passengers, there were carried at the same time 55,242 carriages, 226,439 horses, and 327,147 dogs. The goods traffic shows the following great reF,ults :\u2014There were carried 39,737,074 tons of coal and coke, and of all minerals, 55, 613,641 tons; of general merchandise 26,741,928 tons; while 2,123,833 cattle, 6,076,908 sheep, and 1,270,561 pigs were also carried. The passenger trains travelled over 50,515,081 miles, while the entire distance travelled by all trains was 97,424,179 miles. The money received for the passenger traffic was \u00a312,262,416; and for the goods traffic, \u00a313,950,406; making the total receipts from all sources of traffic, \u00a326,212,822. It is an important point to consider how this wonder- ful system of traffic has been performed in respect of the s ifety to life and limb\u2014a question which, on the recurrence of each railway accident, we are apt, in the actual contemplation and presence of the calamity, to estimate wrongly. Of the 3,811,878 trains, 51 met with accidents; 44 of the accidents were to passenger trains; and of the 173,605,485 passengers, 11 were killed and 371 injured. The total number of passen- gers, servants, and others who suffered by accidents to trains during 1863 on all railways in England and Wales was 18 killed and 402 injured. There were 129 people kille 1 and 419 injured from every cause on railways, including trespassers and people killed or injured at crossings. The amount paid as compensa- tion for personal injury was \u00a3130,794. These are the general statistics, which may be divided into a more particular form. On the London and North-Western 19,185,751 persons travelled, exclusive of 5,372 season- ticketholders ; there were 17 accidents, when 2 passen- gers were killed and 69 injured; \u00a320,000 was pa;d as compensation for personal injury, &c. \u2022 The receipts from pasenger traffic were \u00a32,366,322; from goods traffic, \u00a32,914,937; the proportion per cent. of expendi- ture to total receipts was 46, and the net receipts \u00a32.806,849. The Great Weslern carried 17,291,221 passengers, besides 1,975 holders of season tickets. There were 7 accidents ; 1 passenger was killed by his own m'sconduct, and 37 were injuled from causes be- yond their own control. This company paid \u00a32,176 as compensation for personal injuries. The receipts were: From passengers, \u00a31,799,462 ; from goods, \u00a31,666,196. The proportion of expenditure to receipts was 48 per cent., leaving a profit of \u00a31,793,492. There were 11,011,661 passengers on the Great Eastern line. Four accidents took place, by which 7 passengers were killed and 33 received injuries, which cost the company \u00a38,824 for personal compensation. \u00a3777,920 was re- ceived on account of passengers; \u00a3719,485 from goods; the working expense vas 52 per cent., and the net income \u00a3719,903. The Great Northern had 6,003,515 passengers. There were 7 accidents, whereby 1 assenger was killed and 18 injured. The per cent age for working on this line was 50, and the total gross income \u00a31,594,169; the net income, \u00a3791,182. These returns will serve as examples of the great metropolitan I:nes. But the following particulars are subjoieed to illustrate the working of the purely provincial under- takings: The Lancashire and Yorkshire line carried during 1863, as many as 16,210,097 passengers, from whom an income of \u00a3741,107 was obtained, while the goods traffic yielded \u00a31,037,154, making a total gross income of \u00a31,778,261. The proportion per cent. of expenditure to total receipts was 47, ant the net profits \u00a3947,479. There were three accidents, by which 21 passengers were injured, but none fatally.

FATAL ACCIDENT TO A MARQUIS.\u2014The Florence journals contain accounts of a frightful accident on the fashionable promenade of the Cascine. A number of carriages were drawn up on the open space known as the Piazzone, a favourite rendezvous in which gentle- men are accustomed to proceed from one equipage to another chatting with their friends, or presenting their compliments to ladies of their acquaintance. The Marquis Alessandro Covino was standing at the door of the Countess Gherardi's landau, when the horses of another vehicle taking fright, started off, and before the Marquis could get out of the way, knocked him down, and so fearfully injured him with their hoofs that he expired a few minutes after. The deceased was about forty years of age, and the pos- sessor of a handsome fortune. SMOCKING ACCIDENT AT LLANDUDNO.\u2014This water- ing place was on the 18th inst. the scene of a shocking accident. About five o'clock a jeweller named Griffiths, aged 35 years, left his residence with a friend for the purpose of taking a walk round the Ormeshead. When about two miles round Mr. Griffiths dropped his walking stick down the bank, and while descend- ing in search of it he lost his hold and began rolling down. His companion went to his aid, and found him clinging to a piece of rock that overhangs a precipice. He gave Mr. Griffiths his handkerchief as a support until aid could be received, but the poor man could not retain his hold many moments, and, letting go, he was dashed on the rocks nearly twenty yards below. The alarm was given in the town, and police-serjeant Jones, with four boatmen, took a boat to the spot. The body was found dreadfully mangled, and brought to the town. Deceased has left a wife and three children to mourn his loss. OPENING OF NEW RAGGED SCHOOLS AT WALWORTH.\u2014 On the 19th inst. new ragged schools were opened in Lock's-fields, Walworth. The foundation-stone of the schools was laid on the 10th of May by Mr. M'Arthur, M.P. The building costs \u00a3650, and will accommodate 300 children. About \u00a3450 has been raised. AN OMNIBUS COLLISION.\u2014On the 19th inst. one of the Birmingham Omnibus Company's omnibuses was proceeding down Dale End, when it came in violent collision with a horse and trap belonging to a fish- monger. A boy, named William Mills, was in the trap at the time, and was precipitated to the ground, the trap was upset, and the horse thrown down. With the exception of a strained wrist, the boy received no injury; but the horse had one of its legs broken, and it was afterwards found necessary to destroy the it ni mal. The omnibus and its occupants entirely escaped in- jury. A notice of a recent steamboat explosion in America ends as follows :\u2014\" The captain swath ashore. So did the chambermaid.

Carter concluded the inquiry, at Streat- ham, into the circumstances connected with the Brighton railway accident on the 29th of May last. After several persons employed on the line had been examined, Mr. John Scott Russell was calledly Mr. Faithful, on behalf of the company. He stated that he considered tank engines the safest and best kind of engine that could be used for traffic on this particular line, namely, between Victoria, London-bridge, and Croydon. He had heard nothing to account for the accident, except the irregular shutting off of the steam. Colonel Yolland, who had made an inquiry by direc- tion of the Board of Trade, said that the permanent way was not strong enough to bear the weight of the engine and carriages running at such a speed. He did not think it expedient to run at the rate of sixty miles an hour with tank engines having eighteen feet six inches wheel basis, especially when the engine was not tightly screwed up to the break van behind it. The jury, after deliberating for an hour, returned the following verdict :\u2014\" That the deceased persons seve- rally came by their deaths from accident, and we, the jury, are of opinion that it was attributable to the high rate of speed at which the express trains run over the line from Croydon to Victoria. The jury would urge on the directors of the London and Brighton Company the necessity of allowing more time for the performance of the journey, and that careful attention should be given to the coupling of the trains.\" SHOCKING AND FATAL ACCIDENT.\u2014Mr. Walthew held an inquiry at the Queen's Head Tavern, High- street, Poplar, respecting the death of Joseph Fingane, aged 25, who was killed under the following shocking circumstances :\u2014Deceased was a painter, and on last Friday morning he was employed in decorating the bows of the ship East in Messrs. Carter and Co.'s dry dock, Millwall. While in the act of stepping from one part of a lofty stage to another the platform suddenly overset, and deceased was thrown headlong to the bottom of the dock, a distance of nearly forty feet. He came upon his head, and was killed instanta- neously, his remains being shockingly mangled. The accident arose, it was said, entirely through the fault of deceased in stepping upon a wrong portion of the stage. A verdict of accidental death was returned.","1840":"Mr. nrEoTeEbusTAMwoNiIIIALb e upbrsoes rei loaedd of the Acoldtleerrms,acnomFipsahieliv.. wiTllhbee loasregae ftoorthbyatthgeonatdiemmitaeoraf toO brdoaain\u2022ycitilh( eFedniodgcacyah)sai Obnly, and the Master Cutler (Mr. Mark Firth) will preside.

ACCIDENT ON THE NORTH BRITISH RAILWAY.\u2014An accident befel the Glasgow goods trains which left the Waverley Bridge station at 7.10 a.m. on Saturday morning. It appears that when near Gogar station a waggon spring gave way, and the waggon almost im- mediately afterwards left the rails. Fortunately the other waggons kept the metals, although the train ran nenrly a quarter of a mile before the accident was ob- set vad, and the train could be stopped. Very little damage was done, consi,'ering,, the narrow escape the whole train had of being thrown off the rails. Assist- ance was immediz,tely procured, and after a delay of up, ards of two hours the wag-ion was removed, the traffic during this time being carried on, with more or less delay, on the up-line of rails between Gogar and Corstorphine. The fast passenger train leaving Waverley Bridge station at ten o'clock was delayed forty minutes, much to the annoyance of the passengers. No GAOWb injured by the accident.

If cabmen were allowed to do such things there would be an end to all order. This was a bad case, and the de- fendant must pay the full penalty of \u00a32, and 2s. costs. CONSUMPTION OF HORSE FLESH IN FRANCE.\u2014The report of the Society for the Propagation of the Use of Horse Flesh as an article of Food, says :\u2014ln 1867 the shambles for horse flesh supplied for consumption in Paris 2,152 horses (which number includes some donkeys and mules), representing a nett weight of about 430,400 kilogrammes. In 1868 it sold 484,200 kilo- grammes in weight, being the flesh of 2,421 horses\u2014 an increase of 269 horses, or 53,800 kilogrammes. Last winter new shambles were established at Rheims, Troyes, Toulon, Marseilles, Sedan, Bordeaux, &c. The Prefect of the Guard, by a decree dated the 18th of June, authorised the construction of a special slaughter- house for horses. FEMALE BEAUTY.\u2014M. Bonomi has been measuring the Venus de Medici. He finds that, allowance being made for her position, her height is about Sit. 2in. (Five feet two inches is considered below the middle height, but painters and sculptors give it as the ideal height in such poetic embodiments as those of their Titanias, Undines, Unas, Theklas, Perditas, Mignons, Ophelias, and all those characters in which spiritual perfection is refined and tender rather than sensuously passionate, and inspiring more than sharing what are called strong feelings of the physical kind.) In the statue of the Venus the foot is exactly nine inch es long, rather more than one seventh of the whole height. This does not quite agree with Vitruvius, who gives 1-6th of the height as the proper length of the foot. The greatest width of this Venus's foot is that is 1-18th of the height. Here then, says Bonomi, we have a rule for shoemakers and shoe wearers. Any lady who compresses her foot below these dimensions is not only giving herself pain, but is putting herself \"out of proportion.\" All compression is as imperfect as all over-abundant exuberance; and painters in their delineation of the female form are apt to indulge in the extremity of an embonpoint, as it is called, which only Hottentots would desire in the proportions of their Venuses. ALLEGED GREAT FINANCIAL BLUNDER.\u2014The India papers state that a rumour is widely spread that a blunder of great magnitude has been discovered in the last Indian Budget, and that it is this that has stimulated the zeal of the Government of India on behalf of economy to so extraordinary a pitch. We do not know,\" says the Madras Times, \"what amount of truth may be in the report, but certain it is that the vigorous, we might almost say desperate, use the Supreme Government is making of the pruning knife accords well enough with the statement that that Go- vernment finds itself poorer by two millions than it supposed itself to be when the Budget was unfolded.\" PLUNDERING A MINISTER.\u2014M. Asquerino, Minister for Spain at Brussels, and who is at that moment stay- ing at Ostend, found, on returning to his apartments a few days back, that his trunks and drawers had been broken open, and all his jewels and plate and a sum of 500 f. abstracted. His female servant, whom he had brought with him from Brussels, had also disappeared ; but the police having been informed of the robbery, learned that the woman's sweetheart had arrived in the town that morning, and that two persons, answering the description of the cook and her lover, had left in a cab for Nieuport. The vehicle was consequently fol- lowed and overtaken at Fumes, still occupied by the culprits, in whose possession the stolen property, was found. The two have been committed for trial. FATAL ACCIDENT.\u2014Mr. S. W. Shand, wine merchant, of Liverpool, while being driven from the Rhyl Sta- tion to the house of a friend, accompanied by his host and another gentleman, was thrown from the convey- ance, and received injuries which caused his death. on the 6th inst. The driver and one of his companions were also thrown out, but ezcaped with slight injulies. MORE RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.- -TWO railway accidents occurred on the 6th inst., but the personal injuries sustained in each case were of a slight character only. At Windermere, a Manchester excursion train over- came the break power at the command of the driver and guards, and dashed into the station, bringing a good deal of brickwork down upon the engine. The second accident took place at Garston, near Liverpool, and arose from a passenger train being shunted sud- denly on to a sidinf-, upon which a number of trucks 1 stood. \"Severe shakings\" were sustained by the pas- sengers in each ease. SAD FATE OF Two LOVERS. A violent thunder- storm, accompanied by heavy rain, passed over Brad- ford on the sth inst., and proved fatal to two young people, lovers, who were crossing a footpath between Farsley and Stanningley. The lifeless bodies were found on the footpath by James Walker, cloth weaver, about half-past ten at night. The names of these un- fortunate lovers were Thomas Hardaker, cloth weaver, of Pudsey, aged 21; and Emma Carrick, 22 years of age, daughter of Mr. Henry Carrick, basket maker, Stanningley. AN \"UNCOMMON\" SEA-SHORE OBJECT.\u2014A young lady while searching the beach at Ilfracombe for common objects on the sea-shore\" recently, descried peeping out of the sand what proved to be a valuable diamond mourning ring, with an inscription in memory of the late Lord Rolle. Inquiries were instituted, and it was ascertained that the ring formally belonged to Mr. Drake, now deceased, who was connected with the Rolle family, and was lost by Mrs. Drake about thirteen years ago on the beach at Ilfracombe. It having been given into her charge by her husband SINGULAR off, arid FA T a ALcI careful A search i forrespectably-dressed it, which when he was boating on a stormy dav, she had placed it outside her glove, and in a hurry of landing it had slipped in- stituted at the time, was without success. suLk woman was crossing London Bridge on the afternoon hie wasn elderlyi of the 3rd inst. with two other relatives, when a slight altercation arose as to the direction they should take, when the deceased, it is alleged, appears to have become excited, and, in her anxiety to impress her own views in the matter, stepped backwards from the kerbstone into the roadway, and was knocked down and run over the chest by a waggon which was passing at the time.

Ac.idents on a great scale do not ex- cite so much sensation in America as in England, owing to the area of the country, the varieties of risk, and greater recklcssness of temperament. With thousands on thousands of miles of river navigation, in wild, half-deserted territory, careful inspection or care- ful management is impossible; elaborate precautions would be costly, if not impossible; people, therefore, make up their minds to accidents. Much the same may be said of railrcads. The alternative has been a great number of cheaply and hastily constructed roads, worked at low fares, or a very few expensive and care- fully managed lines for short distances. People chose the former, and when casualties come bear them as soldiers bear the losses of a victory. With mining accidents the people are less familiar, no mines reach the depth of the English mines ; but there is no Govern- ment inspection, and no legally enforced precautions are taken. The late accident occurred in a mine with but one shaft, and round the mouth of the shaft there was a large pile of wcoden buildings, containing stores, hoisting machinery, and so on, dry as tinder under the long drought. It caught fire, and the fire communica- ted with the mine; and, there being no other outlet, even for ventilation, the men were crowded ink, one corner, and miserably perished.","608692":"\u2022 ACCIDENT ON THE GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY.\u2014On the Ist inst. an accident took place on th 3 Great Eastern Railway, within three miles of Brentwood Station. An express train which leaves Brentwood Station at about 10.15 had proceeded on its way some distance towards Romford, when the axletree of the luggage van broke down. The result was a series of most violent concussions and bumps, and as at the spot where the breakdown occurred the line runs on tho top of a steep embankment there was great danger of the train going over. Fortunately the engine was , stopped before any further mischief was done. A. down train took the passengers back to Brentwood., whence they were forwarded as soon as possible to their destinations.

FATAL ACCIDENT TO A MARQUIS.\u2014The Florence journals contain accounts of a frightful accident on the fashionable promenade of the Cascine. A number of ,carriages were drawn up on the open space known as the Piazzone, a favourite rendezvous in which gentle- men are accustomed to proceed from one equipage to another chatting with their friends, or presenting their compliments to ladies of their acquaintance. The Marquis Alessandro Covino was standing at the door of the Countess Gherardi's landau, when the horses of another vehicle taking fright, started off, and before the Marquis could get out of the way, knocked him down, and so fearfully injured him with their hoofs that he expired a few minutes after.

About five o'clock a jeweller named Griffiths, aged 35 years, left his residence with a friend for the purpose of taking a walk round the Ormeshead. When about two miles round Mr. Griffiths dropped his walking stick down the bank, and while descend- ing in search of it he lost his hold and began rolling down. His companion went to his aid, and found him clinging to a piece of rock that overhangs a precipice. He gave Mr. Griffiths his handkerchief as a support until aid could be received, but the poor man could not retain his hold many moments, and, letting go, he was dashed on the rocks nearly twenty yards below. The alarm was given in the town, and police-serjeant Jones, with four boatmen, took a boat to the spot. The body was found dreadfully mangled, and brought to the town.

FATAL ACCIDENT TO A MARQUIS.\u2014The Florence journals contain accounts of a frightful accident on the fashionable promenade of the Cascine. A number of ,carriages were drawn up on the open space known as the Piazzone, a favourite rendezvous in which gentle- men are accustomed to proceed from one equipage to another chatting with their friends, or presenting their compliments to ladies of their acquaintance. The Marquis Alessandro Covino was standing at the door of the Countess Gherardi's landau, when the horses of another vehicle taking fright, started off, and before the Marquis could get out of the way, knocked him down, and so fearfully injured him with their hoofs that he expired a few minutes after. The deceased was about forty years of age, and the pos- sessor of a handsome fortune. SHOCKING ACCIDENT AT LLANDUDNO.\u2014This water- ing place was on the 18th inst. the scene of a shocking accident. About five o'clock a jeweller named Griffiths, aged 35 years, left his residence with a friend for the purpose of taking a walk round the Ormeshead. When about two miles round Mr. Griffiths dropped his walking stick down the bank, and while descend- ing in search of it he lost his hold and began rolling down. His companion went to his aid, and found him clinging to a piece of rock that overhangs a precipice. He gave Mr. Griffiths his handkerchief as a support until aid could be received, but the poor man could not retain his hold many moments, and, letting go, he was dashed on the rocks nearly twenty yards below. The alarm was given in the town, and police-serjeant Jones, with four boatmen, took a boat to the spot. The body was found dreadfully mangled, and brought to the town. Deceased has left a wife and three children to mourn his loss. OPENING OF NEW RAGGED SCHOOLS AT WALWORTH.\u2014 On the 19th inst. new ragged schools were opened in Lock's-fields, Walworth. The foundation-stone of the schools was laid on the 10th of May by Mr. M'Arthur, M.P. The building costs \u00a3650, and will accommodate 300 children. About \u00a3450 has been raised. AN OMNIBUS CoLusioN.\u2014On the 19th inst. one of the Birmingham Omnibus Company's omnibuses was proceeding down Dale End, when it came in violent collision with a horse and trap belonging to a fish- monger. A boy, named William Mills, was in the trap at the time, and was precipitated to the ground, the trap was upset, and the horse thrown down. With the exception of a strained wrist, the boy rec,eived no injury; but the horse had one of its legs broken, and it was afterwards found necessary to degtroy the animal. The omnibus and its occupants entirely escaped in- jury. A notice of a recent steamboat explosion in America ends as follows :\u2014\" The captain swam ashore. So did the chambermaid.

Prisoner, in defence, said it was \"Foresters' day\" at the Palace and he wanted to get a job. Mr. Partridge said the defendant had not only defied the officials of the company, but had tried to drive over one of them, and also made use of bad language. If cabmen were allowed to do such things there would be an end to all order. This was a bad case, and the de- fendant must pay the full penalty of \u00a32, and 2s. costs. CONSUMPTION OF HORSE FLESH IN FRANCE.\u2014The report of the Society for the Propagation of the Use of Horse Flesh as an article of Food, says :\u2014ln 1867 the shambles for horse flesh supplied for consumption in Paris 2,152 horses (which number includes some donkeys and mules), representing a nett weight of about 430,400 kilogrammes. In 1868 it sold 484,200 kilo- grammes in weight, being the flesh of 2,421 horses\u2014 an increase of 269 horses, or 53,800 kilogrammes. Last winter new shambles were established at Rheims, Troyes, Toulon, Marseilles, Sedan, Bordeaux, &c. The Prefect of the Guard, by a decree dated the 18th of June, authorised the construction of a special slaughter- house for horses. FEMALE BEAUTY.\u2014M. Bonomi has been measuring the Venus de Medici. He finds that, allowance being made for her position, her height is about Sit. 2in. (Five feet two inches is considered below the middle height, but painters and sculptors give it as the ideal height in such poetic embodiments as those of their Titanias, Undines, Unas, Theklas, Perditas, Mignons, Ophelias, and all those characters in which spiritual perfection is refined and tender rather than sensuously passionate, and inspiring more than sharing what are called strong feelings of the physical kind.) In the statue of the Venus the foot is exactly nine inch es long, rather more than one seventh of the whole height. This does not quite agree with Vitruvius, who gives 1-6th of the height as the proper length of the foot. The greatest width of this Venus's foot is that is 1-18th of the height. Here then, says Bonomi, we have a rule for shoemakers and shoe wearers. Any lady who compresses her foot below these dimensions is not only giving herself pain, but is putting herself \"out of proportion.\" All compression is as imperfect as all over-abundant exuberance; and painters in their delineation of the female form are apt to indulge in the extremity of an embonpoint, as it is called, which only Hottentots would desire in the proportions of their Venuses. ALLEGED GREAT FINANCIAL BLUNDER.\u2014The India papers state that a rumour is widely spread that a blunder of great magnitude has been discovered in the last Indian Budget, and that it is this that has stimulated the zeal of the Government of India on behalf of economy to so extraordinary a pitch. We do not know,\" says the Madras Times, \"what amount of truth may be in the report, but certain it is that the vigorous, we might almost say desperate, use the Supreme Government is making of the pruning knife accords well enough with the statement that that Go- vernment finds itself poorer by two millions than it supposed itself to be when the Budget was unfolded.\" PLUNDERING A MINISTER.\u2014M. Asquerino, Minister for Spain at Brussels, and who is at that moment stay- ing at Ostend, found, on returning to his apartments a few days back, that his trunks and drawers had been broken open, and all his jewels and plate and a sum of 500 f. abstracted. His female servant, whom he had brought with him from Brussels, had also disappeared ; but the police having been informed of the robbery, learned that the woman's sweetheart had arrived in the town that morning, and that two persons, answering the description of the cook and her lover, had left in a cab for Nieuport. The vehicle was consequently fol- lowed and overtaken at Fumes, still occupied by the culprits, in whose possession the stolen property, was found. The two have been committed for trial. FATAL ACCIDENT.\u2014Mr. S. W. Shand, wine merchant, of Liverpool, while being driven from the Rhyl Sta- tion to the house of a friend, accompanied by his host and another gentleman, was thrown from the convey- ance, and received injuries which caused his death. on the 6th inst. The driver and one of his companions were also thrown out, but ezcaped with slight injulies. MORE RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.- -TWO railway accidents occurred on the 6th inst., but the personal injuries sustained in each case were of a slight character only. At Windermere, a Manchester excursion train over- came the break power at the command of the driver and guards, and dashed into the station, bringing a good deal of brickwork down upon the engine. The second accident took place at Garston, near Liverpool, and arose from a passenger train being shunted sud- denly on to a sidinf-, upon which a number of trucks 1 stood. \"Severe shakings\" were sustained by the pas- sengers in each ease. SAD FATE OF Two LOVERS. A violent thunder- storm, accompanied by heavy rain, passed over Brad- ford on the sth inst., and proved fatal to two young people, lovers, who were crossing a footpath between Farsley and Stanningley. The lifeless bodies were found on the footpath by James Walker, cloth weaver, about half-past ten at night. The names of these un- fortunate lovers were Thomas Hardaker, cloth weaver, of Pudsey, aged 21; and Emma Carrick, 22 years of age, daughter of Mr. Henry Carrick, basket maker, Stanningley. AN \"UNCOMMON\" SEA-SHORE OBJECT.\u2014A young lady while searching the beach at Ilfracombe for common objects on the sea-shore\" recently, descried peeping out of the sand what proved to be a valuable diamond mourning ring, with an inscription in memory of the late Lord Rolle. Inquiries were instituted, and it was ascertained that the ring formally belonged to Mr. Drake, now deceased, who was connected with the Rolle family, and was lost by Mrs. Drake about thirteen years ago on the beach at Ilfracombe.

Carter concluded the inquiry, at Streat- ham, into the circumstances connected with the Brighton railway accident on the 29th of May last. After several persons employed on the line had been examined, Mr. John Scott Russell was calledly Mr. Faithful, on behalf of the company. He stated that he considered tank engines the safest and best kind of engine that could be used for traffic on this particular line, namely, between Victoria, London-bridge, and Croydon. He had heard nothing to account for the accident, except the irregular shutting off of the steam. Colonel Yolland, who had made an inquiry by direc- tion of the Board of Trade, said that the permanent way was not strong enough to bear the weight of the engine and carriages running at such a speed. He did not think it expedient to run at the rate of sixty miles an hour with tank engines having eighteen feet six inches wheel basis, especially when the engine was not tightly screwed up to the break van behind it. The jury, after deliberating for an hour, returned the following verdict :\u2014\" That the deceased persons seve- rally came by their deaths from accident, and we, the jury, are of opinion that it was attributable to the high rate of speed at which the express trains run over the line from Croydon to Victoria.

Ac.idents on a great scale do not ex- cite so much sensation in America as in England, owing to the area of the country, the varieties of risk, and greater recklcssness of temperament. With thousands on thousands of miles of river navigation, in wild, half-deserted territory, careful inspection or care- ful management is impossible; elaborate precautions would be costly, if not impossible; people, therefore, make up their minds to accidents. Much the same may be said of railrcads. The alternative has been a great number of cheaply and hastily constructed roads, worked at low fares, or a very few expensive and care- fully managed lines for short distances. People chose the former, and when casualties come bear them as soldiers bear the losses of a victory. With mining accidents the people are less familiar, no mines reach the depth of the English mines ; but there is no Govern- ment inspection, and no legally enforced precautions are taken.

It caught fire, and the fire communica- ted with the mine; and, there being no other outlet, even for ventilation, the men were crowded ink, one corner, and miserably perished.","608692":"\u2022 ACCIDENT ON THE GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY.\u2014On the Ist inst. an accident took place on th 3 Great Eastern Railway, within three miles of Brentwood Station.

The men were thrown into the water, and being heavily attired, two of them sank and were drowned; while Enfield Todd managed to extricate himself, and swam to the beach.

Much the same may be said of railroads. The late accident occurred in a mine with but one shaft, and round the mouth of the shaft there was a large pile of wooden buildings, containing stores, hoisting machinery, and so on, dry as tinder under the long drought. It caught fire, and the fire communicated with the mine; and, there being no other outlet, even for ventilation, the men were crowded in, one corner, and miserably perished.###","608692":"Here is the cleaned and corrected text:\n\nACCIDENT ON THE GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY.\u2014On the 1st inst. an accident took place on the Great Eastern Railway, within three miles of Brentwood Station.

Fleming, 20, proceeded out of the harbour in a new boat, for the purpose of drawing for some smelts and other fish along the shore. Just as they reached the bar, and precisely where the late life boat catastrophe took place, their small boat was caught by a sea and swamped. The men were thrown into the water, and being heavily attired, two of them sank and were drowned; while Enfield Todd managed to extricate himself, and swam to the beach.

After several persons employed on the line had been examined, Mr. John Scott Russell was called by Mr. Faithful, on behalf of the company. He stated that he considered tank engines the safest and best kind of engine that could be used for traffic on this particular line, namely, between Victoria, London-bridge, and Croydon. He had heard nothing to account for the accident, except the irregular shutting off of the steam. The jury, after deliberating for an hour, returned the following verdict :\u2014\" That the deceased persons severally came by their deaths from accident, and we, the jury, are of opinion that it was attributable to the high rate of speed at which the express trains run over the line from Croydon to Victoria.","1840":"A shocking and fatal accident has happened at Accrington Station to Mr. M.

The great railway accidents in the neighbourhood of London in 1861 arose from the employment or over-working of badly-paid men in positions of trust, and they cost more money to the shareholders than they will save by shabby economy, low wages, and over-time and over-work.

Accidents on a great scale do not excite so much sensation in America as in England, owing to the area of the country, the varieties of risk, and greater recklessness of temperament. With thousands of miles of river navigation, in wild, half-deserted territory, careful inspection or careful management is impossible; elaborate precautions would be costly, if not impossible; people, therefore, make up their minds to accidents. Much the same may be said of railroads. The late accident occurred in a mine with but one shaft, and round the mouth of the shaft there was a large pile of wooden buildings, containing stores, hoisting machinery, and so on, dry as tinder under the long drought. It caught fire, and the fire communicated with the mine; and, there being no other outlet, even for ventilation, the men were crowded in, one corner, and miserably perished.","608692":"ACCIDENT ON THE GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY.\u2014On the 1st inst. an accident took place on the Great Eastern Railway, within three miles of Brentwood Station.
