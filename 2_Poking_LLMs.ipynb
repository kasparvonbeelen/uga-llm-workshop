Two young men, Horatio Crack-\\nnell, seventeen, and Robert Walker, nineteen, both well\\ndressed, were charged with attempting to extort \\u00a34O\\nfrom Mr. Henry ,Cordell Juler, a physician in large\\npractice, and a governor of St. Mary's Hospital. The\\ntwo prisoners called on. Mr. Juler one evening, and after\\naccusing him of an infamous crime, said they would not\\nprosecute if he would give them hush-money. Mr.\\nJuler was perfectly dumbfounded at the charge made\\nagainst him, and. uncertain how to act, but ultimately\\nhe arranged to meet the prisoners at his house on\\nanother evening. He then informed his son of every-\\nthing which had happened. The result of this was that\\nyoung Mr. Juler hid himself behind the curtains in the\\ndrawing-room during the time the complainant had a\\nsecond interview with the prisoners. They asked \\u00a34O\\nas a bribe for remaining silent, and, aften some conver-\\nsation, Cracknell wrote a document, and signed it, and\\nWalker also signed it, which was to the effect that for the\\nsum of \\u00a34O they would keep the matter a profound\\nseeret. Mr. Juler, after obtaining possession of the\\ndocument, seat for a police-constable and gave the\\nprisoners into. custody.
